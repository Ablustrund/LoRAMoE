though the UN refuses to accept any legal liability.\nWhile the UN sees itself as a force for democratisation, it is a ridiculously undemocratic organisation.\nIts locus of power is the Security Council, where the five permanent members - the US, Britain, France, China and Russia - still wield crippling vetoes.\nThe Security Council, like amber encasing an extinct insect, preserves the influence of the victors from World War Two, freezing a moment in a time.\nTellingly, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt coined the phrase the \"United Nations,\" he was referring not to the countries of the world but rather the Allied powers.\nGermany and Japan do not have permanent seats on the Security Council, nor do India or Brazil.\nThough every country has a vote in the General Assembly, a less powerful body, almost 75% of the world's population is effectively disenfranchised in the Security Council.\nThere, preposterously, one veto-wielding power can thwart the will of the other 192 members.\nAll five veto powers have to agree, for instance, on the appointment of secretaries general, enabling weak, if well-intentioned, compromise candidates, like the present leader Ban Ki-moon, to reach the top.\nFor all its shortcomings, however, the United Nations can look back on much of the past 70 years with pride.\nIt is credited with brokering more than 170 peace settlements, though it has proved better at preventing nation-to-nation conflicts rather than civil wars.\nThe Cold War never turned hot, although there were Cold War proxy conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Angola, Afghanistan and elsewhere.\nThe number of people killed in conflicts has declined since 1945.\nFewer died in the first decade of this century than in any decade during the last.\nIts peacekeeping operations, which began during the Suez crisis in 1956, have expanded to 16 missions around the world, keeping and monitoring the peace in Haiti to Darfur, Cyprus to the Golan Heights.\nThe UN has codified a panoply of international laws and forged the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.\nIt has helped broker major international treaties, such as the landmark, nuclear non-proliferation treaty that came into force in 1970, and helped organise historic elections, such as the first presidential contest in Afghanistan in 2004.\nThe work of UN agencies, much of it unnoticed and unsung, has been impressive, partly because they employ some of the world's leading experts in disaster relief, public health and economic development.\nNot only are their staff expert, but often incredibly brave and dedicated.\nPartly because of the efforts of Unicef, deaths of children under the age of five have declined from nearly 12 million in 1990 to 6.9 million in 2011.\nThe UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, has helped 17 million asylum seekers and refugees, picking up two Nobel peace prizes, in 1954 and 1981, for its efforts.\nThe World Food Programme each year gives assistance to 80 million people in 75 countries.\nThe preservation of 1,031 of the world's most beautiful sites, from the Serengeti National Park to Machu Picchu, is partly thanks to the cultural agency Unesco.\nIts Millennium Development Goals, which will soon be superseded by the Sustainable Development Goals, have been described as the greatest anti-poverty drive in history.\nOften, however, the work of agencies is hindered by a lack of funding from member states, which is often called donor fatigue.\nThere is a chronic shortfall in Syria, for instance, where only 38% of the funding requirements have been met.\nOf the $4.5bn needed by the UN to confront the Syrian refugee crisis, only $1.8bn has been contributed.\nThe UN's convening power, the simple fact that it brings together 193 members, is obviously unique.\nStill, all too often its members deliberately hamper its work.\nUN agencies would like to deliver humanitarian aid to Syria, to use one example, but for much of the past five years the Security Council has not mandated them to do so.\nRussia, with the backing usually of China, has used its veto as a block to protect its ally, Syria's President Bashar al-Assad.\nThis kind of obstructionism and negative statecraft is common at the UN.\nCritics of Israel, a country that regularly complains of being unfairly vilified at the UN, bemoan the regular use of US vetoes to shield it from international criticism.\nOften the UN doesn't solve the world's problems, but merely reflects them.\nAs the late US diplomat Richard Holbrooke once memorably said, blaming the UN is rather like blaming Madison Square Garden when the New York Knicks lose.\nIt is the players that count, and they who ultimately decide on whether the UN succeeds or fails as a multinational problem-solver.\nSyria offers a case study of the UN at its best and its worst.\nThe deadlock in Security Council has stymied peace efforts, but the UN runs the massive Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, the home to almost 80,000 displaced people.\nThat camp could never in any way be described as \"heaven\".\nBut it has saved those seeking shelter from \"hell\".",

Overnight, coalition aircraft targeted the defence ministry building in Sanaa and weapons storage sites.\nSaudi Arabia asked Pakistan last month to contribute ships, aircraft and troops to the campaign to restore Mr Hadi to power.\nBut after days of debate, Pakistan's parliament voted to \"maintain neutrality in the Yemen conflict so as to be able to play a proactive diplomatic role to end the crisis\".\nAnalysts say Pakistan, which has a Sunni majority but also a sizeable Shia minority, fears being caught between the two if it sends troops to Yemen.\nWho is fighting whom in Yemen?\nHouthis - The Zaidi Shia Muslim rebels from the north overran Sanaa last year and then expanded their control. They want to replace Mr Hadi, whose government they say is corrupt. The US alleges Iran is providing military assistance to the rebels.\nAli Abdullah Saleh - Military units loyal to the former president - forced to hand over power in 2011 after mass protests - are fighting alongside the Houthis.\nAbdrabbuh Mansour Hadi - The president fled abroad in March as the rebels advanced on Aden, where he had taken refuge in February. Sunni Muslim tribesmen and Southern separatists have formed militia to fight the rebels.\nSaudi-led coalition - A US-backed coalition of nine, mostly Sunni Arab states says it is seeking to \"defend the legitimate government\" of Mr Hadi.\nAl-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - AQAP opposes both the Houthis and President Hadi.

To investigate what the women of Scotland want from the independence debate - never mind the outcome - we decided to have an all-female cast of contributors.\nThis wasn't to alienate the good men of Scotland but to ensure we crammed the programme with as many disparate female voices as possible.\nThe spark for \"What Women Want\" was a poll by the influential Scottish Social Attitudes Survey that highlighted a sustained gender gap in voting intentions.\nWho? Voters in Scotland will go to the polls to vote on their country's future.\nWhat? They will be asked the yes/no question: \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\"\nWhen? The vote takes place on Thursday, 18 September, 2014.\nFor as long as the organisation has asked a question about independence - about 15 years - women have been less keen on voting Yes by a consistent six or seven percent margin. Combine that with the disproportionate number of women who say they are undecided, and you have a societal grouping that could prove pivotal for September's outcome.\nWe wanted to get to the root of why so many women felt unable to make a decision and why, among those who'd professed an opinion, so many felt independence wasn't the road to travel.\nIt's easy for people like me who've been interviewing politicians on the referendum debate since Adam was a boy to assume every word of it is fed into Scotland's homes to be analysed and debated, but that's clearly nonsense.\nNormal people have other priorities, and it could be argued that because so many women have families or are carers, our lives tend to be more fragmented. It's not that we work any harder, let's just say we often have more plates spinning than men.\nOn the search for women from all walks of life a night at the bingo proved an eye-opener and a humiliation. You would imagine that hearing a number and marking a card is fairly straightforward. It's not. Trailing three numbers behind the caller was a bit disconcerting; having the elderly lady next to me take over my card while marking three of her own, was downright embarrassing.\nWhen I wasn't interrupting their games the women at the bingo were keen to tell me how they felt they weren't being served by the Yes and No campaign. Time and time again I heard a plea for transparency in the debate and a hope that the politicians would stop shouting at each other and provide some facts.\nWhether or not there are facts to be had in this most crucial of decisions is debatable in itself, but as far as the women we spoke to are concerned, at least some straight talking wouldn't go amiss.\nThe programme also decided to tackle head on the hypothesis that women are more risk averse and therefore prone to sticking with the status quo, i.e. the UK. Try telling the ladies of Edinburgh's Auld Reekie Roller Girls, who meet on a Friday night and knock lumps out of each other on roller skates, that they're a bunch of fearties.\nThe fact that the paramedics arrived and hauled one of the roller ladies off for a night in the infirmary was passed off as a regular, but mild inconvenience.\nWere women simply afraid of independence and its leap into the unknown? The general consensus at the roller derby seemed to be no, but as the Roller Girls are on first name terms with the staff at the fracture clinic, perhaps they weren't an entirely representative bunch.\nThere was certainly more time for considered thinking at the huge wedding fair that took over much of the SECC.\nOnce the brides-to-be and their assorted mums and pals realised that my camera crew and I were interrupting their day to talk politics rather than place settings they were surprisingly forthcoming. I suppose you can't prepare for a life of wedded bliss and even plan a family without taking cognisance of the sort of country you want to live in.\nIt's clear to me, having ambushed women to carry out similar interviews six months ago, that there has been a big shift. From general apathy back then there is now a widespread hunger for information and for certainties.\nAs I've said, the cynic in me very much doubts either side can offer the copper-bottomed facts at least this half of the electorate so badly wants, but I hope I'm proved wrong.\nAway from the civilians in this battle, the seasoned political warriors we spoke to did try to convince us of the surety of their positions, as you'd expect.\nNicola Sturgeon chatted to us in her kitchen which she revealed, with disarming honesty, she rarely visited. She also conceded that unless women could be persuaded to favour independence the referendum would not be won.\nWe spoke to powerful women in the unionist camp too, as well as historians, writers, professors - and even a neuroscientist. We cleaned gutters - or rather I did - we shopped for clothes and put a focus group of undecided women under the spotlight and gave them a grilling.\nOverall, we tried to represent some of the diverse roles Scotswomen in the 21st century find themselves in while they ponder their country's future. And did we eventually discover what women want? Of course I'm not telling you, you'll have to watch the programme to find out.",

The thought behind it, I think, was the thought which drove the then British government into focusing very hard on Iraq.\"\nThe phrase \"draining the swamp\" is commonly attributed to Chairman Mao - but Dr Yiyi Lu, a Chinese expert at Chatham House, said she did not immediately recognise the phrase and that its meaning seemed \"too vague\".\nAsked about the decision to go to war, Mr Pattison said the UK was driven by rather \"idealistic\" motives rather than direct concerns about its own security or a decision to alter the balance of power in the region.\n\"I think Tony Blair's view was always that - the idealists' view that we were doing this to make the world a safer place. We were not doing this because there was a direct threat to the UK; we were doing this because it was in the interests of the international community and because it was in the interests of the international community he expected the international community to step up to the plate and do it.\"\nThe Iraq Inquiry is concluding its latest round of hearings - expected to be the last before it starts the process of compiling its report.\nFormer foreign secretary Jack Straw will give evidence for the third time on Wednesday.",

In the middle of that there is space for tables and chairs, where families can eat together, just like at home with soft furnishing and beautiful lighting.\nThe clinical equipment will be there, but very much in the background.\n\"It's got a domestic-sized front door,\" explains Ms Baillie.\n\"As soon as you walk in there will be no barriers of having a desk you have to walk up to and the first thing you'll see is a fireplace, so all of that signifies home.\"\nThe hospice has been housed in its present building on the banks of the Clyde for more than 30 years.\nThe architects spent time understanding how it worked before they started on the new building.\n\"This project has influenced me hugely,\" says Alastair Forbes, architectural director with Ryder Architecture.\nPart of what he was trying to do was use the layout of the building to limit the time staff would spend away from patients and to break down the scale of the place.\nIt is designed to look like four interlinked houses.\nIt also meant a first for him in his career as an architect as he spent time examining how a room looks when you are lying in bed. It is something which he says has become a \"touchstone\" for him in the project.\n\"What a patient sees, how much they see the ceiling, how much they don't actually see out the window,\" he explains.\n\"It's a very clinical environment, it's the smells, it's the noises, the proximity to staff, to other patients, personalisation you can see there is quite difficult.\"\n\"Everything's about people.\"\nThe design of the new hospice building also considers its parkland setting with rooms which allow patients to see the sky and the gardens from their bed, as well as giving them and their families the opportunity to eat together.\n\"Coming from a Pakistani background, you cook for your family and friends all the time,\" says Saf Akram.\nHis sister spent time at the hospice towards the end of her life and his mum cooked at home for her and brought the food in.\n\"Then we'd come in from work, and get a little nibble of whatever she had for the day. I'm sure if they'd had a kitchen there my mum would have cooked for everybody, she's just that kind of person.\"\nHe adds: \"That's exactly what they need down here, somewhere you can join in as a family, continue your family life in a place where you're getting the clinical care you need.\"",

It's important that the parties uphold the agreement that all of us reached,\" he said.\nAt the start of the debate, the DUP was accused of \"killing off discussion\" of the bill.\nUlster Unionist Roy Beggs said the DUP had done so by  tabling a series of petitions of concern against amendments to the bill.\n\"They have displayed the undemocratic nature of their attitudes as MLAs and the undemocratic nature of their party, which of course has the word democracy in their name,\" he said.\nMr Robinson rejected Mr Beggs' claim that his party's actions were \"shameful\".\nThe measure was designed as a way to safeguard minority rights in Stormont's power-sharing assembly.\nIf a petition of concern is presented to the assembly speaker, any motion or amendment will need cross-community support.\nIn such cases, a vote on proposed legislation will only pass if supported by a weighted majority (60%) of members voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting.\nEffectively this means that, provided enough MLAs from a particular community agree, that community can exercise a veto over the assembly's decisions.\nApart from the amendments tabled by Social Development Minister Mervyn Storey of the DUP, only two others - put forward by the UUP - survived.\nHowever, Mr Robinson, the first minister, said assembly members were still capable of discussing the bill as well as the amendments.\nThe SDLP's Alex Attwood accused the DUP of trying to run a \"coach and horses\" through the amendments.\n\"Never before in the life of the chamber has there been such a swingeing attempt through petitions of concern to shut down what might be good law for the people of this part of the world,\" he said.\nSinn Féin's Martin McGuinness said some SDLP assembly members were defying their party leader Alasdair McDonnell by tabling the amendments in the chamber.\n\"The SDLP dissidents are clearly now in charge of the party and are prepared to risk the collapse of the Stormont House Agreement - and thereby the power-sharing institutions themselves - for the sake of party political grandstanding,\" he said.\nGenerally, Northern Ireland Assembly bills reach their consideration stage a few months after MLAs first debate their principles.\nThe fact that two years and four months have passed since this bill was last on the floor of the chamber shows just how difficult the arguments over welfare reform have been.\nHowever, the essential deal was struck before Christmas, with the parties accepting the introduction of universal credit and personal independence payments, to replace benefits such as jobseeker's allowance, tax credits and disability living allowance.\nStormont is providing support for those adversely impacted financially by the changes to the welfare system by setting aside nearly £30m to assist claimants who lose out in 2015/16.\nSinn Féin has claimed the fund will amount to more than £500m over the next six years.",

In fact, the country has seen more than $400bn (Â£267bn) invested in clean energy in the past 10 years, and is ranked number one in the world in consultancy EY's renewable energy country attractiveness index.\nAccording to Wang Tao, one in every four units of power generated now comes from wind, solar or hydro plants, and a new debate has begun, focusing not on the need to build more renewable energy plants, but on how to best utilise this new and still rapidly growing resource.\n\"We have to make sure that people have the incentives to continue to invest in these renewables, and also that consumers will be able to know and to choose wisely in terms of what kind of electricity they consume, and also change their behaviour,\" he says.\nAnd where once everyone spoke about the huge vested interests in China's fossil fuel-powered sectors, many believe the government is starting to take them on.\n\"In Hubei Province,\" Li Yan says, \"we are observing very bold and firm action to close down the dirtiest fleet of the iron, steel and cement sector, even at the cost of temporary job losses.\n\"I think that's a painful process, but it's also a demonstration of how important the air pollution agenda is in this region.\"\nGreenpeace's great fear had once been that China was preparing for a huge shift towards coal gasification projects - rather than using coal directly to fuel power plants, using it to produce natural gas.\nWhile the end product may be cleaner, critics argue that the industrial processes involved in the conversion emit more greenhouse gases and have other serious environmental impacts, like the huge amount of water consumed.\nBut even here, there appear to be signs of a bit of a rethink going on.\nChina's state-run media has cited an unnamed policymaker as saying that while the country will complete the construction of already approved coal-to-natural-gas plants, it will not approve new ones, at least until 2020.\nIt is of course much too early to suggest that China is turning its back on King Coal.\nThe fuel will make up the majority of its energy sector well into the next decade, a period over which it will continue to burn well over 3 billion tonnes of it every year.\nBut even as new power plants come on stream, it seems likely that - if it hasn't already happened - very soon the overall reliance on coal will begin to decrease and more and more of those new plants will be forced to operate below capacity.\nIf the slowdown in economic growth becomes more serious and sustained, then some environmentalists believe we could yet see the Chinese government lurch for another bout of stimulus spending, pouring money into the big energy-intensive industries and sparking another coal boom.\nBut for now, there are signs that China's unbearable air has become the catalyst for at least the beginnings of a fundamental change in direction.",

It's been pretty grim actually.\"\nThe killings at Charlie Hebdo in Paris last week have further focused attention on radical Islamism in Europe, and the safety of Jewish communities in France, Germany and the UK.\nAt one Limmud seminar, Michael Whine, of the Community Security Trust (CST), which seeks to protect Jewish communities and offer advice on security, sought to place last summer's figure in a wider European perspective, citing research by the Institute for Jewish Policy Research showing that Jewish people in the UK felt safer than those in France.\nHowever, CST figures still showed a significant rise in both verbal and physical attacks on Jewish people in the UK in 2014 compared with 2013, with 543 recorded in July and August 2014 alone - although the percentage of violent attacks - 7% - did not rise in the UK, unlike France.\nOver the weekend, Ephraim Mirvis, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, joined the march in Paris, and the memorial service at the Great Synagogue there.\nHe said he was pleased to have the opportunity \"to express solidarity with the people of France and the French Jewish Community\".\n\"We stand together at this time challenging time.\"\nThe Senior Rabbi to the Movement for Reform Judaism in the UK, Laura Janner-Klausner, also went to Paris.\nShe travelled with a Muslim colleague to join the march with well over a million others, to show solidarity with the French, of all faiths and none.\nShe said they wanted to demonstrate that all communities could work together to counter the hatred and extremism manifested in the attacks last week.\n\"Some parts of the Jewish community in Paris were still suffering from the trauma of what happened there,\" she said.\n\"Some had heard the shots being fired at Charlie Hebdo, so they were frightened.\n\"Some were tearful, and emotional. But they were not saying, 'Now we are going to pack our bags and leave.'\n\"They were saying,' This is our home, and we don't want the narrative to be that we are leaving because of this.'\"\nNonetheless, she said that anti-Semitism in France was more obvious and public than in the UK.\n\"There, the anti-Semitism can be palpable, whereas in Britain what we generally experience is a wonderful sense of integration.\n\"This is where we live, this is where we want our children to go to school and grow up. If the worst happened in the UK, which it could, this is still our home.\"\nMany believe that the legacy of France's colonial history in north Africa still drives much of the anti-Semitism evident there.\nSome Muslim immigrants from Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia - even now in the second and third generation - continue to feel excluded from the mainstream in France.\nMany live very separate lives in the grimmer suburbs around Paris and other major cities, where unemployment is high and prospects are often limited.\nJewish immigrants to France from north Africa often integrated faster and have sometimes enjoyed better economic prospects, leading to tensions between the two.\nAt the same time, both communities often live side by side, but remain in many cases divided by the perception amongst some younger Muslims that while they struggle to be accepted in France as truly French, Jewish families have not had as much of an uphill task.\nYet some 7,000 French Jewish people chose to leave for Israel last year, a record number, thanks partly to a rise in anti-Semitic attacks, although a dearth of jobs and economic stagnation may also have played its part.\nSome French Jewish people have also moved to London, to seek work or education there.\nIn the UK this week, the CST said there would be increased police patrols in Jewish areas, as a visible reassurance to the community.\nThe hope is that it is only a precaution, not a necessity, with Jewish-Muslim relations in the UK enjoying a more harmonious history than in France.\nIn the UK, Justin Cohen, news editor of the Jewish News, says that nonetheless: \"British Jews are still on edge following the huge increase in anti-Semitism last summer, and the horrific events in Paris have heightened tensions.\n\"Still, there is a clear difference between that and the levels of hate faced by the community in France.\n\"And it is absolutely not the case that British Jews are packing their bags to leave, as is the case across the Channel.\n\"Nevertheless, members of the British Jewish community are all too aware that, alongside US, British and Israeli sites, Jewish ones are high up in the target list for Islamist fundamentalists.\n\"Jewish schools and institutions will be going about their usual business today, but with this and fresh calls for vigilance uppermost in their minds.\"\nThe worry remains that the virulent strain of Islamist extremism that exploded on to the world stage again so violently in France last week is an ideology that can be used by extremists anywhere to seek to divide communities, different faiths and societies across the world.\nThe challenge now for many is how to strengthen interfaith ties to resist that attempt.",

Its figures, however, cover incidents dating back to April.\nThe force found that there had been 11 misogynistic \"hate crimes\" - offences including harassment, kidnapping, possession of weapons and causing public fear, alarm or distress.\nThere were also 19 \"hate incidents\" - behaviour also motivated by misogyny but falling short of criminal acts, such as name-calling and offensive jokes.\n\"We're not saying all men engage in this behaviour, but for some women this has become an everyday experience. A lot of men are not aware of the implications it has on women,\" said Loretta Trickett, a criminologist at Nottingham Trent University.\n\"Up until now, women have largely not reported this. Women put up with it because it is trivialised in society. People say it's complimentary to be wolf-whistled.\n\"I think the new recording will give women reassurance that if they call the police, their incident will be registered and they will do something.\"\nMartha Jephcott, who has trained Nottinghamshire police officers on how to deal with misogyny as a hate crime, said: \"Recognising misogyny as a hate crime is important because it acknowledges the world in which women live and the everyday nature of these sorts of incidents.\"\nFifteen police forces will attend a conference in Nottingham on Wednesday, looking at the possibility of adopting similar schemes, which they hope will increase the reporting of harassment.\nMs Jephcott said: \"I want forces across the country to adopt this. I think it's a matter of equality.\n\"UK-wide, racist and homophobic hate crimes take place and are recognised as such. Women should have that too because, wherever they are, they probably will have experienced this.\"\nNottinghamshire Police define misogynistic hate crime as \"incidents against women that are motivated by an attitude of a man towards a woman and includes behaviour targeted towards a woman by men simply because they are a woman\".\nThe classification means people can report incidents which might not otherwise be considered to be a crime and the police will investigate.\nDomestic abuse will not be recorded as a misogyny hate crime because it has its own procedure.\nA crime that the victim or any other person perceives to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards any aspect of a person's identity.\nPolice forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland annually monitor five strands of hate crime:\nForces can include their own definition of a hate crime with several recently adding sub-cultures.\nThe Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.",

Thirty kilometres is already completed, while 100km more remains under construction.\n\"The purpose of the fence,\" says Philip Gunev, deputy interior minister, \"is to divert flows of migrants towards border crossing points where our limited financial resources allow us to protect European borders in a more efficient way\".\nSuch official checkpoints, he insists, are safer for asylum seekers than trudging long distances, often with small children, over the rough, hilly terrain the fence now cuts across.\nFixed and mobile cameras, mounted on four-by-four vehicles, complete the picture along the whole length of the border.\nIn the past eight years, since joining the European Union, Bulgaria has spent €300m (£215m) of mostly EU money, reinforcing this border. Another €100m is available to complete the job until 2020. Only €2m will be received for the better integration of refugees in the same period.\nKrassimir Kanev, director of the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights advocacy groups, is unhappy with the checkpoints.\n\"The only way to get through is to pay smugglers,\" he says, arguing that only the richer migrants get a chance to try. \"And there's nothing safe about being cramped in the hidden compartment of a truck in the heat of summer.\"\nAbout one third of Bulgaria's migrants are caught on the border with Turkey, another third as they head north or west inside Bulgaria, and the rest on the Serbian or Romanian borders, as they try to continue their journey towards Hungary on their way to Germany.\nBulgaria has one of the highest rates of granting refugee status in the EU. Refugee status means they also receive a Convention Travel Document (CTD) and under the 1951 Refugee Convention they can travel on to anywhere in the EU and stay for up to 90 days.\nIn practice, few ever come back, travelling to Germany or elsewhere.\nAt the Harmanli refugee camp in south-eastern Bulgaria, two police buses bring more asylum seekers.\nChildren wave happily, adults look more concerned.\nConditions here are much better than they were in 2013, when overcrowding, appalling sanitary conditions, and the alleged cruelty of guards gave Bulgaria a bad name.\nSome asylum seekers still express frustration at delays with their applications.\nA group of men hold up a snake they killed in the camp the day before. But most acknowledge a big improvement in conditions for the 1,600 refugees here.\nBulgaria is facing growing pressure from Western governments to identify exactly who they do let in.\nNinety percent arrive with no documents whatsoever because they were taken by the smugglers who brought them this far.\nIn an upstairs room at Harmanli, officers from the Bulgarian intelligence services cross-examine the refugees, most of whom are Syrian Kurds.\nWhile Harmanli is an open camp, those deemed suspect are taken to a prison at Busmantsi, near Sofia, where they can be detained for up to a year, while more investigations are carried out.\n\"The most frustrating thing about life there was the waiting,\" said one former Busmantsi inmate, who asked not to be named.\n\"Your whole life is waiting. You know there will be an end to all this, and one day you will be out, but at this moment you have nothing to do but wait.\"\nAre there radical Islamists inside the prison? I ask.\n\"People keep themselves to themselves. They only share what they have to,\" he tells me. \"But the radical mood among my friends is all about money, which comes mostly from Saudi Arabia. It has nothing to do with political or religious beliefs.\"\n\"Don't link those fleeing terror with those who would like to create it,\" says Boris Cheshirkov, a UN refugee agency spokesman in Bulgaria. \"States can protect refugees, and address security concerns too, by screening and registering them early on.\"",

It is not clear how effective the recall will be in reducing the numbers of vulnerable devices hackers can call on to mount attacks.\nYes, and it probably will. The smart devices making up the IoT are proving very popular with the malicious hackers who make their living by selling attack services or extorting cash by threatening firms with devastating attacks.\nBefore the rise of the IoT it was tricky to set up a network of hijacked machines as most would be PCs that, generally, are more secure. Running such a network is hard and often machines had to be rented for a few hours just to carry out attacks. Now anyone can scan the net for vulnerable cameras, DVRs and other gadgets, take them over and start bombarding targets whenever they want.\nFor the same reason you would care if your car was stolen and used by bank robbers as a getaway vehicle.\nAnd because if your webcam, printer or DVR is hijacked you have, in effect, allowed a stranger to enter your home. Hackers are likely to start using these gadgets to spy on you and scoop up valuable data. It's worth taking steps to shut out the intruders.\nNot easily. Many of the devices being targeted are hard to update and the passwords on some, according to one report, are hard-coded which means they cannot be changed.\nThere is also the difficulty of identifying whether you are using a vulnerable product. A lot of IoT devices are built from components sourced from lots of different places. Finding out what software is running on them can be frustrating.\nAlso, even if recalls and updates are massively successful there will still be plenty of unpatched devices available for malicious hackers to use. Some manufacturers of cheaper devices have refused to issue updates meaning there is a ready population of vulnerable gadgets available.\nBecause security costs money and electronics firms want to make their IoT device as cheap as possible. Paying developers to write secure code might mean a gadget is late to market and is more expensive. Plus enforcing good security on these devices can make them harder to use  - again that might hit sales.\nDespite this, many industry bodies are trying to draw up standards that enforce good security habits. Unfortunately, these initiatives are taking time to have any impact, meaning there are millions of insecure devices already installed and working.\nRight now, we don't know. Some hacker groups have claimed responsibility but none of their claims are credible. We might never know because the vulnerable devices making up the IoT attack network are changing hands regularly as rivals scramble to gain control of as many as they can.\nIn one sense the large web attacks are marketing exercises which show how effective a particular network of bots can be when turned against a target. Competition among rival bot operators is ferocious so a successful attack can be a good way to impress potential customers. It might also persuade victims of extortion emails to pay up rather than risk being knocked out.",

Cigarettes will go up by 16p a pack as earlier planned.\nLabour leader Ed Miliband said Mr Osborne had \"failed working families\".\n\"This a Budget that people won't believe from a government that is not on their side,\" Mr Miliband told MPs.\nThe Lib Dems - who will set out their own tax and spending plans on Thursday - claimed credit for coalition plans to raise the personal income tax allowance to £10,800 next year, more than previously expected.\nUsers of the BBC News app tap here for the Budget Calculator.\nLib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable told BBC News: \"Where we differ from the Conservatives... is that we don't believe you can deal with this deficit problem simply by cutting public spending.\n\"Many of our public services are already under a lot of pressure so we will be arguing for a different mix.\"\nIn his final set-piece pitch to voters before May's election, Mr Osborne announced that if the Conservatives win power the first £1,000 of savings interest would be tax free - meaning 95% of savers would pay no tax.\nHe also said savings put aside for a deposit by first-time buyers would be topped up by the government - to the tune of £50 for every £200 saved - in a move that will come into force this Autumn. The new Help to Buy ISA accounts will be made available through banks and building societies.\nOther measures include:\nMr Osborne hailed slightly better than expected growth figures, which suggest the economy will expand by 2.5% this year, rather than 2.4% and described his economic package as a \"Budget for Britain - a comeback country\".\nHe said the government had met its 2010 target to end this Parliament with Britain's national debt falling as a share of GDP, meaning the \"the hard work and sacrifice of the British people has paid off\".\nMost computers will open PDF documents automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader\nDownload the reader here\nSetting out his plans in the Commons, Mr Osborne said: \"We took difficult decisions in the teeth of opposition and it worked. Britain is walking tall again.\n\"Five years ago, our economy had suffered a collapse greater than almost any country.\n\"Today, I can confirm: in the last year we have grown faster than any other major advanced economy in the world.\"\nHe said he would use a boost in the public finances caused by lower inflation and welfare payments to pay off some of the national debt and end the squeeze on public spending a year earlier than planned.\nIn 2019/20 spending will grow in line with the growth of the economy - bringing state spending as a share of national income to the same level as in 2000, the chancellor told MPs.\nThe BBC's Robert Peston said this was a move aimed at neutralising Labour's claim that the Conservatives would cut spending to 1930s levels.\nBut Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said the Treasury's own figures showed spending at the \"lowest level since 1938\" in 2018/19 while the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, in its analysis, said Mr Osborne's plans implied a \"rollercoaster profile\" for expenditure over the next five years.\nMr Osborne insisted that deficit reduction remained his top priority but also unveiled measures aimed at increasing the amount people can earn before paying tax to £10,800 next year and an above inflation rise to £43,300 by 2017 for the amount people can earn before having to pay the 40p tax rate.\nSome of the plans in Mr Osborne's statement are likely to depend on a Conservative victory on 7 May. Whoever wins the election is likely to set out another Budget later this year.\nIf you think getting the debt down is the big priority, the last five years have seen a good deal of austerity for very delayed gain.\nIt is taking precisely twice as long as George Osborne hoped to get the debt down to 70% of GDP.\nAnd to achieve that deferred gain, the Office for Budget Responsibility says the acuteness of austerity will get worse, before it gets a lot better.\nRead Robert's full analysis here.\nLabour leader Ed Miliband claimed the Conservatives had a \"secret plan\" to cut the NHS because they would not be able to deliver their planned \"colossal cuts\" to other areas of public spending and they would also be forced to increase VAT.\nHe said Labour would reverse the tax cuts for millionaires and introduce a mansion tax to fund the NHS.\nHe also pledged to abolish the \"vindictive and unfair\" housing benefit changes he calls the \"bedroom tax\".\nThe SNP said Mr Osborne had \"blown his last chance\" to deliver for Scotland.\nSNP deputy leader and Treasury spokesman Stewart Hosie said: \"Today George Osborne could have delivered a Budget focused on delivering economic growth by tackling inequality.\n\"He has not - he has decided to continue with his utterly failed austerity agenda.\"\nThe chancellor sprayed largesse far and wide - on drinkers and drivers, orchestras and air ambulances, churches and charities.\nSo yes no massive giveaway, no massive rabbit, as some Tory MPs had wanted, but a glimpse of better things to come and the road - as Mr Osborne put it - from austerity to prosperity. But the essential political argument hasn't changed.\nRead James's full analysis here.\nUKIP Leader Nigel Farage said: \"Mr Osborne talks about a long-term economic plan, today he pushed all his targets back and created a long grass economic plan.\"\nGreen Party leader Natalie Bennett said the chancellor's \"triumphalist tone\" would \"leave a bad taste in the mouth\" of people on zero hours contracts or struggling to put food on the table.\nPlaid Cymru Treasury spokesman Jonathan Edwards said: \"This was a 'jam tomorrow' Budget from a chancellor who is busy sharpening the axe ready for the next Parliament.\"\nMr Osborne's sixth Budget statement came against a backdrop of a strengthening economic recovery, a fresh fall in unemployment and a rosier picture expected as a result of falling oil prices dragging down inflation.\nIn was, in parts, an openly electioneering Budget, with Mr Osborne saying: \"The critical choice facing the country now is this: do we return to the chaos of the past? Or do we say to the British people, let's work through the plan that is delivering for you?\"\nThe Budget was largely welcomed by business leaders with CBI Director General John Cridland saying it would provide the \"stability and consistency\" needed to boost growth.\nThe trade unions were less impressed, with the TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady saying: \"He did not spell out where, if re-elected, he will make the huge spending cuts he plans for the next Parliament, nor did he tell Britain's low paid workers which of their benefits he will cut.\"",

Of course, there is a very long way to go because the problems are huge.\"\nIt is estimated that 5-13 million tonnes of plastics flow into the world's oceans annually. Much of it is ingested by birds and fish â€“ and fragments of plastic have even been found in organisms at the bottom of the ocean.\nA recent paper said much of the marine plastic often originates far from the sea â€“ especially in countries which have developed consumer economies faster than their ability to manage waste.\nThe  Helmholtz Centre in Leipzig, Germany, estimated that 75% of land-borne marine pollution comes from just 10 rivers, predominantly in Asia.\nReducing the plastic loads in these rivers by 50% would reduce global plastic inputs by 37%, it said.\nTom Dillon from the Pew Charitable Trusts, which campaign on oceans, urged China to move quickly.\nHe told BBC News: \"For thousands of years the Maritime Silk Road was a pathway for export of Chinese culture and influence. Will the ocean be a vehicle for export of Chinese pollution, or a new culture of conservation and sustainability?\"\nA report to the UN conference from the Thailand government says most marine plastic debris is land-based, caused by inefficient waste management and poor handling of plastic wastes.\nIn Thailand, the total amount of garbage finding its way into the sea was estimated at 2.83 million tonnes in 2016 - of which 12% was plastic.\nThe Thai government says the nation has established a 20-year strategy to tackle the problem, including developing financial incentives for keeping plastic out of the sea and encouraging eco-packaging design and eco-friendly substitutes for plastics.\nIn Indonesia, the government is starting a mass education programme for schoolchildren, and in the Philippines new laws are being developed.\nPart of the challenge is finding substitutes for plastics.

Prof Stephen Hawking's assessment of artificial intelligence offers a tantalising glimpse into what we might be reading more about  next year - the endless rise of the intelligent machine.\nJanuary: 'Super-rare' Nintendo games hits eBay\nFans of old video games were queuing up to get their hands on a copy of Nintendo World Championships, one of only 116 copies made as part of a special event in 1990.\nA first bid of $4,999 (Â£3,000) set the tone for the eBay auction.\nEven though the cartridge was in poor condition, its rarity - designed for a competition and never put on general sale - meant it would be something of a holy grail for keen collectors, according to gaming experts.\nThe game eventually sold to a bidder for over $99,0000 - although the winning bidder later backed out.\nFebruary: Flappy Bird creator removes game from app stores\nThe game theme continued into February when everyone was talking about the new gaming sensation - Flappy Bird. Seen as a natural successor to Angry Birds, it proved short-lived when its Vietnamese creator Dong Nguyen announced that he was removing the game from online stores.\nMany questioned whether the real reason was because he may have faced legal action from Nintendo as the main characters resembled those in Super Mario Bros.\nBy the time it was withdrawn the game had been downloaded more than 50 million times, making it the most popular game of the year.\nFor those who had it installed on their phones, it put an immediate premium on the device with people selling handsets on eBay for $1,000 until the online auction site put an end to such trades.\nMarch: Thousands make #nomakeupselfie donation error\nBefore the ice bucket challenge took hold this summer, another charity-raising craze hit social media in the spring - taking a self portrait wearing no make-up.\nOnce the picture was posted on social media, users were asked to donate to Cancer Research UK.\nBut unfortunately not all of the funds raised by the stunt went to the intended cause.\nThe BBC discovered that thousands of pounds were accidentally donated to Unicef instead of Cancer Research UK, as people sent money by texting DONATE rather than BEAT.\nUnicef told the BBC that over Â£18,000 had been identified as being accidentally pledged to it and that it was working with Cancer Research to transfer the money.\nApril: Heartbleed Bug: Tech firms urge password reset\nIt took a quarter of a year for the first big security story to hit but when it did it was a big one.\nThe Heartbleed bug affected software used by millions of web servers with some advising people to stay away from the internet entirely until it was fixed. One security expert said that on a scale of one to 10, Heartbleed was an 11.\nThe biggest story of the month was not the one revealing the bug but a follow-up in which several tech firms advised people to change all their passwords.\nThat suggestion proved controversial, with other experts later pointing out that even if users created brand new logins they would remain at risk until all the online services they used updated their servers.\nMay: eBay makes users change their passwords after hack\nThe security theme continued through the spring with May's biggest story focusing on eBay's security woes.\nThe US online marketplace admitted that a database had been hacked between late February and early March, which had contained encrypted passwords and other non-financial data.\nBut there was confusion about how eBay would communicate the problem to its 128 million active users.\nInitially it said it would oblige users to choose new passwords but later said that it would be optional.\nJune: Android and Windows to get 'kill switch'\nThe middle of the year saw efforts by the tech industry to combat the problem of mobile phone theft which police said had risen dramatically.\nAccording to a report by the US authorities, some 3.1 million mobile device were stolen in the US in 2013, double the number stolen in 2012.\nBy adding a kill switch, a function that would render any stolen device useless, they hoped to cut the crime.\nIn June Google and Microsoft announcing that they will add a kill switch feature to their phone operating systems.\nApple already offered such a switch and according to US reports the theft of iPhones had fallen significantly in the months following the launch.\nJuly: Naked selfies extracted from 'factory reset' phones\nIn July it was reported that a Czech-based security firm had managed to extract thousands of pictures, including naked selfies from mobile phones that users thought had been wiped.\nAvast used publicly-available forensic security tools to find the images from second-hand phones bought on eBay.\nIt warned that the only way to completely delete data is to destroy your phone.\nAugust: Man jailed for filming Fast and Furious in cinema\nPiracy is always a hot topic and there was proof in August that it is not going away any time soon with news that a man had been jailed after recording Fast And Furious 6 from the back of a cinema in Walsall.\nThe Federation Against Copyright Theft (Fact) claimed it meant millions of pounds lost for the film's distributor, Universal Pictures.\nPhilip Danks, 25, was jailed for 33 months after the movie he uploaded was downloaded 700,000 times.\nThe judge said his behaviour was \"bold, arrogant and cocksure.\"\nSeptember: Apple Watch unveiled alongside larger iPhones.\nIt wouldn't be possible to get through a year in tech without a new product launch and this time it was details about Apple's smartwatch that grabbed attention.\nThe watch will offer 11 different watch faces and will run Siri - Apple's voice-activated digital assistant.\nIt will also offer maps and act as a heart rate monitor.\nThe watch goes on sale in 2015 and will compete with a crowded market but Apple chief executive Tim Cook was hopeful that its history of entering sectors relatively late and then changing the landscape would prove true for watches as well as phones and music players.\nOctober: Nude 'Snapchat images' put online by hackers\nThe readership of the BBC technology site seem to like a headline if it includes the phrase 'naked images' - and in October a second such tale took their fancy.\nThis time it was news that hackers had put explicit images sent through messaging service Snapchat online with threats to upload more.\nHalf of Snapchat's users are aged between 13 and 17, raising concern that many of the images may be of children.\nSnapchat blamed third-party apps but security experts said that it too had to take more responsibility over user data.\nNovember: Breached webcam and baby monitor site flagged by watchdogs\nNovember saw the extraordinary tale of a website containing thousands of live feeds to baby monitors and CCTV systems around the world.\nIt included a child's bedroom in Birmingham, an office in Warwickshire and a shop in London.\nThe site, based in Russia, broadcast footage from all the systems that used either default passwords or no log-in codes at all.\nIt claimed that it was simply highlighting the dangers of weakly protected cameras but others felt it was a gross violation of people's privacy.\nThe UK's information commissioner Christopher Graham described the feeds on show as \"spooky\" and said he was working with the Russian authorities to have the site shut down.\nDecember: Stephen Hawking warns artificial intelligence could end mankind\nA cheery note to end the year when world-renowned scientist Prof Stephen Hawking revealed his fears about the development of artificial intelligence.\nHis view was that the rise of the intelligent machine could signal the end of the human race and his thoughts hit a note with the public - the story was one of the most read of the entire year.\nMost industry watchers are marking out artificial intelligence as one of their 'technologies to watch' next year although it may be a little longer until it poses any real threat to its human overlords.",

Reports from Gaza say the stadium has in the past been used as a site to launch rockets.\nAmong the casualties on Wednesday was a six-year-old boy.\nThe health ministry in Gaza says a doctor at the Shifa hospital was called to treat the boy. When he reached the patient, he found it was his own son and the boy was dead, the health ministry said.\nThis is the eighth day of the current flare-up in violence between Israel and militants in Gaza.\nSome 152 Palestinians and five Israelis have been killed, officials say.\nIn other developments:\nOther sites hit in Gaza included a banker's villa, tunnels to Egypt used by smugglers and a media office, said to be linked to Hamas, that was situated two floors above the Agence France-Presse office in Gaza City.\nEarlier, the IDF said 62 rockets fired by militants from Gaza had hit Israel on Wednesday, while another 20 were intercepted by its Iron Dome missile defence system.\nThe latest violence will further complicate ceasefire discussions taking place in the region.\nIn the West Bank, Mr Ban expressed \"profound concern\" at the civilian casualties in Gaza and also called on militants to end immediately their \"indiscriminate attacks on Israeli population centres\".\nMrs Clinton held talks with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem before heading to Cairo.\nOfficials from Hamas had suggested on Tuesday that a truce would come into effect at midnight, but Israel later said it had not agreed to a text.\nIsrael's demands include no hostile fire of any kind from Gaza and international efforts to prevent Hamas from re-arming, while Hamas is demanding an end to the blockade on Gaza and targeted killings by Israel.\nIsrael launched its current offensive a week ago with the killing of Hamas military leader Ahmed Jabari. The Israeli government says his assassination, and the subsequent offensive, is designed to end rocket fire from Gaza.\nIsrael has troops massed along the Gaza border but says it is holding off on a possible ground invasion as talks continue.",

The manager was planning for next season and even held meetings about transfer targets earlier this week before Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. There was a quiet confidence behind the scenes that, in the apparent absence of attractive offers, Moyes would stay at Goodison Park after his contract expires this summer.\nNow owner Bill Kenwright must find a successor to the man who has led Everton for 11 years.  Swansea's Michael Laudrup and Wigan Athletic manager Roberto Martinez head the list but other candidates will merit discussion, such as departing Everton captain Phil Neville.

  "instruction": "Read the following document and then please summarize this document. \n Document:\nKids Company shut its doors in early August, just days after Matthew Hancock and Oliver Letwin, ministers at the Cabinet Office, told officials to pay it £3m.\nThis payment would always have been controversial: a senior civil servant had used a rarely-deployed formal process (\"seeking a ministerial direction\") to publicly note his reservations about plans to fund the charity.\nThe NAO, Parliament's spending watchdog, however, reveals that civil service worries were very longstanding.\nThe document will bolster concerns that the charity was, indeed, extremely poorly run: civil servants complained for more than a decade about its management under Camila Batmanghelidjh, its former chief executive, and Alan Yentob, the charity's chair of trustees from 2003 until it closed (he is also the BBC's creative director).\nThe fundamental question that the NAO sought to address is why, given concern about the charity for more than a decade, Kids Company was able to raise more than £40m from government departments.\nThe document provides some evidence that the answer to this question is that the charity followed what Ms Batmanghelidjh referred to in an internal 2002 strategy document as a \"bully strategy\" to get money: threatening ministers \"with the outcomes of failing to deliver care to children\".\nThe NAO says that the charity \"followed a consistent pattern of behaviour that we observed in 2002, 2005, 2007, 2010, 2012 and 2015, each time Kids Company approached the end of a grant term... Kids Company [would] lobby the government for a new funding commitment.\"\nIt continues: \"If officials resisted, the charity would write to ministers expressing fears of redundancies and the impact of service closures.\n\"Around the same time, Kids Company would express the same concerns in the media.\n\"Ministers [would] ask officials to review options for funding Kids Company. Officials would award grants to Kids Company.\"\nThe document includes concerns noted by officials which recurred in part or in full throughout its life: officials told ministers in 2002 that Kids Company had been weakly managed, was not well regarded at a local level, that government funds would be put at risk if the charity failed, that a bail-out would set an unhelpful precedent and that there were other investments that could offer better value for money.\nThe NAO published a large table setting out which of these and other concerns were subsequently raised by officials in 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2015.\nMeg Hillier, chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said: \"It is unbelievable that over 13 years taxpayers' money has been given to Kids Company with little focus on what it was actually achieving for the children it was supporting.\n\"Government repeatedly raised concerns about Kids Company's finances but little action was taken. Despite this, government gave it further grants - funded by the taxpayer.\"\nAnd so, after a lot of analysis of the charity, the focus of the Kids Company saga now passes to Whitehall and Westminster.\nAs the charity's constant champions, ministers have something to fear. In mid-November, the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee (PACAC) expect to question Mr Hancock and Mr Letwin about their funding of Kids Company.\nBut the NAO report may provide them with a crumb of comfort. They will be able to point to other ministers who over-ruled civil service advice to bail Kids Company out.\nThey might argue that they were just the ministers who had the bad luck to be in post when it finally collapsed.\nThe NAO report confirms that the civil service was pressed into funding the charity by ministers, but the saga is awkward for them, too. They, too, expect a grilling from MPs.\nOn Monday, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) will be taking testimony from Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department for Education, and Richard Heaton, the official who, when permanent secretary of the Cabinet Office, publicly raised objections before approving funding for the charity.\nBut even Mr Heaton has something to worry about. The NAO report reveals he was also the accounting officer for the Cabinet Office when it sponsored £7.4m of previous grants.\nThe NAO also gazettes the various failed attempts by officials in the Department for Education and Cabinet Office to improve the charity's management.\nFor example, in 2013, the DfE \"awarded a £200,000 contract to Methods Consulting Ltd (Methods) to monitor and evaluate the grant funding to Kids Company\".\nHowever, the \"scope of its work did not include looking at the quality of the charity's services\". They only counted the volume of it.\nAssessed on this basis, the charity always met its targets - often by improbable margins: \"Kids Company reported that against a target of 1,347 interventions in 2013-14, they delivered 30,217 interventions.\"\nThat occurred under Mr Wormald's watch. He needs to be able to explain how this was allowed to happen, especially as one concern that has emerged since Kids Company's closure is that it appears to have have a much smaller client-base than it had been claiming.\nNo-one's hands are clean here.\nThis document, at least, closes one chapter in this story: one investigation has ended.\nThe NAO's investigation into Kids Company is done. But the Public Accounts Committee, the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, the Charity Commission, the London Borough of Southwark and the Metropolitan Police are still looking into the charity.",

We will not reveal our hand prematurely and we will not provide a running commentary on every twist and turn of the negotiation.\"\nDuring her statement, Mrs May was urged to set out what the government wanted to achieve from Brexit negotiations, with the SNP's Westminster leader Angus Roberston asking: \"Does she seriously expect to be able to hold out for years in not confirming whether she wants the UK to remain a member of the single market?\"\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was \"unclear\" what the government was \"trying to do\".\nHe accused Mrs May of supporting \"free trade dogma\" rather than a policy that \"values human rights and human dignity\".\nThe Labour leader later faced calls to clarify whether he supported the UK's continuing membership of the EU single market.\nLabour sources said Mr Corbyn thought the UK's Brexit negotiations should aim to secure \"full access to the single market\" in goods and services.\nBut a spokesman for the Labour leader said Mr Corbyn had campaigned against aspects of the single market and would oppose a deal that included \"aspects of the existing architecture\" that were damaging to working people and public services.\nAsked if Mr Corbyn wanted the UK to remain a full member of the EU single market the spokesman said there was a question about what \"membership of the single market\" actually meant.\nLabour MP and Remain campaigner Chuka Umunna called for clarity from his party, saying: \"Labour should be fighting for Britain to stay in the single market, not turning a blind eye to its advantages.\"\nThe government does not plan to begin the formal two-year Brexit process by triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty until the start of next year at the earliest.\nBrexit Secretary David Davis has predicted a \"round of global trade deals\" will be \"fully negotiated\" within 12 to 24 months, coming into force when the UK leaves the EU.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme after meeting UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, Mr Ciobo said the UK-Australia deal could only happen \"when the time is right\", adding that there had been \"good alignment\" between the two sides.\n\"The timing around that will in many respects be dictated by the UK,\" he said.\n\"The discussions with the EU, the nature of those, the length of them is all yet to be determined.\"\nBased on the UK triggering the two-year long Article 50 process of leaving the EU in the first half of 2017, he said such a deal would be \"at least two and a half years off\".\nFormal negotiations would have to wait until Brexit had been completed, but Mr Ciobo said \"preliminary discussions around what a post-Brexit Australia-UK trade deal might look like\" were taking place already.\nAustralia would be \"well and truly engrossed in negotiations\" over its on-going deal with the EU in the meantime, with formal talks due to begin next year, he said.\nThe UK has no trained trade negotiators of its own, because it cannot sign deals while an EU member - and Mr Ciobo said he had offered to loan Australian experts to the UK for the talks.\nMajor exports from Australia to the UK include lead, gold, alcoholic beverages and pearls and gems.\nGoing the other way, according to government figures from 2014, the UK's top exports to Australia include medicines and pharmaceuticals, scientific instruments, clothing accessories and electrical machinery.\nAfter their meeting in London, Mr Fox and Mr Ciobo agreed that officials would meet twice a year to discuss the parameters of what both sides said they hoped would be an \"ambitious and comprehensive\" deal.\nIn a joint statement, they announced the creation of a working group to discuss areas of mutual co-operation including future investment opportunities.\nThe working group's first meeting will be in Australia in January.\nAs well as considering bilateral links, it will look at relevant international trade standards including World Trade Organization rules.\n\"We want the working group to advance an agenda that will ensure the expeditious transition to free trade agreement negotiations when the UK has formally completed its negotiations to exit the EU,\" the two men said.",

  "instruction": "Read the following document and then please summarize this document. \n Document:\nOn arrival, they find their iPads and smartphones suddenly only serve for taking photos which, to their dismay, can't be immediately posted to their Instagram or Facebook accounts.\nWhether Snapchat-obsessed millennials or email-addicted workaholics, they stare at their phones in disbelief, waiting in vain for the familiar  \"4G\" symbol to appear, as the realisation dawns that an enforced digital detox is upon them.\nConversely, plenty of travellers to Cuba relish the chance to disconnect from the office emails and the constant barrage of WhatsApp alerts and tweets.\nYet what for the tourist is either a temporary inconvenience or a welcome offline breather is a very different reality for ordinary Cubans.\nFor years, it felt to many on the island like the internet was something happening elsewhere, to other people.\nRecently though, it is easier, and cheaper, to get online in Cuba than it used to be.\nThere are now more than 240 public access wi-fi spots dotted around the country and the price for an hour of internet access, while still expensive by international standards, has dropped by more than half, to $1.50 (£1.20) for an hour.\nIt is now a common sight to see people sitting with their laptops or phones in parks and public plazas connecting with their families abroad via video-chat technology.\nIn the latest development, the state telecommunications company, Etecsa, has installed internet connections in around 2,000 homes in the capital's colonial district, Old Havana, as part of a two-month pilot scheme.\nAmong the lucky few is Jose Antonio Ruiz.\nHis modest apartment in one of the neighbourhood's newer buildings is part of the government's domestic online experiment. As a private business owner who rents rooms to tourists, Mr Ruiz has found the new \"luxury\" helped him in two main ways.\nFirst, he says, he can advertise his apartment more easily on popular accommodation websites like Airbnb, and answer his clients' emails much more promptly than before.\nSecondly, he can offer his guests a unique service giving him a competitive advantage over other guesthouses.\n\"The guests are really pleased when you tell them we have internet,\" Jose Antonio explains. \"They relax as they know they can check their flights from here, read their emails or contact their families.\"\nDuring the pilot, the connection is free but once it's over the government is expected to publish prices, so users can choose whether to keep the service or live without it.\nIt hasn't yet been confirmed but it is believed it will cost around $15 (£12) for 30 hours at the slowest speed of 128 kilobits per second, and up to $110 (£90) for the fastest - two megabits per second.\nWith the average wage in Cuba about $25 (£20) a month, those prices would be prohibitively expensive for many Cubans.\nJose Antonio's connection is not fast enough to stream video, for example. Still, it is an improvement on the dial-up connections that some state employees have at home and he says he'd pay to keep it as it's enough for what he needs.\nOne day, though, those needs could change, says Cuban youth blogger Ariel Montenegro.\n\"The digital transformation of a country is not just giving people the internet, but giving them services on the internet, Cuban services,\" he explains at a public access wi-fi point in the Vedado neighbourhood of Havana.\n\"Like banking or paying your bills or buying tickets for the movie theatre or applying to college. When those kinds of national services start to happen online then people will naturally become more impatient.\"\nSuch a move will take time, he thinks. However, much has already happened in a relatively short period.\n\"If you compare it with the rest of the world, of course we're still behind,\" admits Mr Montenegro. \"But it's progress. When I started college, although we had the internet, it was really, really, really slow. You could barely do anything.\"\n\"In five years' time, I believe that at least every university will have a really fast internet connection as well as in libraries, in schools and more public wi-fi spots.\"\nThe Cuban government's position on the internet is twofold.\nFirst it blames the US economic embargo for the lack of information technology in Cuba, saying that many of the major IT firms around the world fear running foul of Washington's strict rules on trading with Cuba.\nSince the bilateral thaw of December 2014, that has been harder to argue, of course. Last year Google reached an agreement with Etecsa on storing its online content, such as YouTube video and Gmail, on servers inside Cuba to improve local access. Google executives are also keen to provide further internet-based solutions to challenges on the island.\nHowever, there is also a lingering official distrust of unfettered internet access.\nWhether stemming from an ill-advised USAid-run programme intended to undermine the Castro government via a text message-based form of \"Cuban Twitter\" called ZunZuneo or a broader suspicion of social media as a tool of dissent, the authorities have traditionally been wary of the net.\nFollowing his meeting with Raul Castro last year, the then British Foreign Secretary, Phillip Hammond, told the BBC that the 85-year-old Cuban president \"clearly understands the power of the digital economy to drive growth\" but had also raised his concerns over \"the negative aspects of the internet from online radicalisation to child sexual exploitation\".\nMr Castro has a little under a year to go before he steps down from the presidency. His expected successor, Vice-President Miguel Angel Diaz Canel, is thought to be receptive to greater online access after he once publicly defended a group of young bloggers who had posted relatively critical material online.\nAs the home internet pilot scheme draws to an close, the Cuban government must next decide whether to shut it down or roll it out across the island.\nDepending on the price, many thousands of potential users are ready to connect.",

Our planet is covered with atmosphere  . Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and reaches the Earth. The Sun heats up the Earth's surface. When the heat rises into the air, it is stopped by some special gases  in the atmosphere like CO2, the heat returns to the Earth and keeps _ warm.\nPower stations and cars release   so many greenhouse gases every day. So we can help stop global  warming by using less electric things such as turning off lights when we leave a room, asking our parents to turn down the heating in our house to save energy. We can also stop global warming by finding other ways of transportation. For example, ride a bicycle or walk instead of going by car. Another way to help stop global warming is to plant and care for trees. Because trees take in CO2, they are our best friends when fighting against global warming.\nThe problem of global warming cannot be solved in a day. It may take a long time to find clean energy, such as wind energy. It may take a long time to plant the trees again we are cutting down. But every little thing each person can do to save energy and our forests will help. Think about our planet. Think about ways we can help make the Earth a safe and comfortable place for the future.\nQuestion: Which is the best title of this passage?\nOptions: A: Why is the Earth warming up\nB: When can we stop the Earth from warming up\nC: How can we stop the Earth getting warmer\nD: How long will it take to stop the Earth getting warmer\n",

Not only no green, but also the temperature reaches about 121degC all day even in winter because there is too much CO2 circling the earth.\nOn the land, there is no life.

Computers are used to control all the machines, even the people's life. We can also make the seawater into fresh water. There are two machines making oxygen. If they stop working for only one minute, more than 10 million people will die.\nThe population of our city is over 30 million and, of course, it is quite crowded.

Read more and find more facts.\nWhen Nelson Mandela was a young man, white and black people in South Africa lived separate lives. White people, who were a small part of the population, were in charge of the country.

He was one of the few black people in the 1950s of South Africa to receive education and become a successful lawyer.\nNelson Mandela believed that everybody should be treated equally. He joined some different demonstrations to fight against a system called apartheid.\nSometimes the demonstrations turned violent and in 1962 Mandela was sent to a prison which was on Robben Island. But many people around the world campaigned for his release. Songs were written and big concerts were held in protest. Finally in 1990 the South African President FW de Klerk--a white man--allowed him to go free.

Twain wrote it in the everyday English of the southern states of America in the 19thcentury, so it sounds very real. Today it's thought to be one of the greatest books in American literature.

When I got home, my friends all said that I had improved so much! I hope to go back again in the future.\nCarla Fonseca - Rio de Janeiro\nI spent last year studying English in London.

I think it was a good experience for me, but I'm glad to be home!\nAlvin Chen - Hong Kong\nStudying in New Zealand was a fun experience for me, but it was also lots of hard work! I had English classes six hours a day, five days a week----with lots of homework. I also kept a diary of my experience. I like to write, and I wrote two or three pages in my diary every day. On Saturdays, my homestay family took me to lots of interesting places and showed me so many wonderful things about the culture.

Many students do not like to worry about money, and they would rather not think about it. But, it doesn't matter whether a student's parents pay for everything, or whether the students work part-time to help pay for his or her education. All students can get into money trouble if they're not careful.\nThe cost of a college education can be quite expensive. In English-speaking countries, the average cost per student per year is well over US$10,000. Students must also pay for books, paper, pens, and etc. These can cost $500 to $1,000 per year. Students who live in university housing pay thousand more per year for room and board . Add money for clothes, travel, and other personal expenses, and the cost of one year at a university can be $20, 000 to $30,000 or more.\nStudents need to spend their money carefully. At most universities, advisors can give students advice on how to budget  their money. They suggest this: at the start of a school term, write down your income; for example, money you will get from your family or a part-time job. Then, list all of your expenses. Put your expenses into two groups: those that change (food, phone, books, travel), and those that will stay the same (tuition, room and board). Add together all of your expenses. Are they more than your income? Do you have enough money, or do you need more?\nLearning not to spend more money than you have is not always easy. But for many, it is easier than borrowing money from family or friends.\nQuestion: What can we infer from the passage?\nOptions: A: College students needn't worry about money.\nB: It's important to follow the advisors' advice.\nC: Students can spend more than their income.\nD: Borrowing money from others is very easy.\n",

Researchers gave one group of fruit flies normal food, and another group of fruit flies got the same food including apple.\nThe results showed that flies that ate apple lived an average of 55 days longer than the flies that didn't eat apple. The study also found that apple-eating flies were more able to walk, climb and move about as they became old, the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry reports.\nThe researchers believe that the antioxidants  found in apples are good for health.\nIn another experiment, researchers studied the diets of thousands of women. They found that those women who often ate apples were 20 percent less likely to have heart disease.\nScientists have recently discovered the apple's genetic code . This allows scientists to make new kinds of fruit that are healthier. Researchers are already using this information to grow apples with added antioxidants. Antioxidants help to keep eyes and joints  healthy and protect against heart attacks and cancer.\nApples that help people lose weight may be in supermarkets in just four or five years.

Or how hard it is to be among people laughing and not laugh yourself? Well, obviously it's because we have mirror neurons   in our brains.\nPut simply, the presence of mirror neurons suggests that every time we see someone else do something, our brains model after it, whether or not we actually perform the same action. This explains a great deal about how we learn to smile, talk, walk, dance or play sports. But the idea goes further: mirror neurons not only appear to explain physical actions,they also tell us that there is a biological basis for the way we understand other people.\nMirror neurons can undoubtedly be found all over our brains,but especially in the areas which relate to our ability to use languages,and to understand how other people feel. Researchers have found that mirror neurons relate strongly to language. A group of researchers discovered that if they gave people sentences to listen to (for example: \"The hand took hold of the ball\"), the same mirror neurons were _ as when the action was actually performed (in this example, actually taking hold of a ball).\nAny problems with mirror neurons may well result in problems with behavior. Much research suggests that people with social and behavioral problems have mirror neurons which are not fully functioning  . However, it is not yet known exactly how these discoveries might help find treatments for social disorders.\nResearch into mirror neurons seems to provide us with ever more information about how humans behave, communicate and spend time together. Indeed, it may turn out to be nearly the same important thing for neuroscience as what Einstein's theory of relativity   was for physics. And the next time you have the strong feeling to cough in the cinema when someone else does - well, perhaps you'll understand why.\nQuestion: Mirror neurons can explain   _  .\nOptions: A: why we cry when we are hurt\nB: why we cough when we catch a cold\nC: why we smile when we see someone else smile\nD: why we yawn when we see someone else get up late\n",

Just be relaxed, try to catch every word.\nSomebody may be a good listener. But he is terrified to speak. He's afraid of making mistakes. You know we sometimes make mistakes when we speak Chinese. Don't be afraid. We must be brave. If you really want to learn English well, you must try to speak with everyone so long as he knows English. Whether you know him or not is not important. When there's nobody to talk with, you can talk to yourself in English. It's interesting and also a good way to practice your spoken English. Remember, the more you speak, the fewer mistakes you'll make.\nReading and writing are more important for senior school students. First we must choose the books we're interested in. A lot of reading will improve your language sense . This is the most important.\nKeep writing English diaries. We can also write English articles. You may even post them to English magazines. Don't be afraid of failure. Failure is the mother of success.\nEasier said than done. Well, let's do more practice from now on. I'm sure you'll learn English better in this way.\nQuestion: You can learn to swim by  _  .\nOptions: A: reading books about it\nB: looking at others swimming\nC: having lessons on it\nD: going into the water and learning\n",

Most Chinese hotels often provide guests with things like disposable  toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo and slippers. Many guests like the idea because they don't have to bring their own. But ,if you travel to Beijing , remember to bring your own things. Starting from June, some hotels in Beijing will no longer provide guests with these disposable things. They want to ask people to use less disposable things.\nMany disposable things are made of plastic. People throw them away after only using them once. It is a waste of natural resources  and is very bad for the environment. Do you know, one Chinese makes as much as 400kg of waste a year! Most of that waste comes from disposable things. In Beijing, people throw away about 19,000 tons of plastic bags and1,320 tons of plastic lunch bowls every year! Plastic can take between 100 and 400 years to break down. So the less plastic we throw out, the better. So, wherever you travel, bring your own things and use them again and again.\nBack at home and at school, you can also do something, you can also do something to make our world a better place. Try to do these things in your daily life: Use cloth shopping bags, not plastic ones. After using a plastic bag, wash it out and let it dry. Then you can use it over and over again.

  "instruction": "In 1863, Alexander II re-convened the Diet of Finland and initiated several reforms increasing Finland's autonomy from Russia including establishment of its own currency, the markka. Liberation of business led to increased foreign investment and industrial development. Finland also got its first railways, separately established under Finnish administration. Finally, the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. Alexander II is still regarded as \"The Good Tsar\" in Finland.

Zed (Sean Connery), a Brutal Exterminator, hides aboard Zardoz during one trip, temporarily \"killing\" its Eternal operator-creator Arthur Frayn (Niall Buggy).\nArriving in the Vortex, Zed meets two Eternals â Consuella (Charlotte Rampling) and May (Sara Kestelman). Overcoming him with psychic powers, they make him a prisoner and menial worker within their community. Consuella wants Zed destroyed immediately; others, led by May and a subversive Eternal named Friend (John Alderton), insist on keeping him alive for further study.\nIn time, Zed learns the nature of the Vortex. The Eternals are overseen and protected from death by the Tabernacle, an artificial intelligence. Given their limitless lifespan, the Eternals have grown bored and corrupt. The needlessness of procreation has rendered the men impotent and meditation has replaced sleep. Others fall into catatonia, forming the social stratum the Eternals have named the \"Apathetics\". The Eternals spend their days stewarding mankind's vast knowledge â through a voice-recognition based search engine â baking special bread for themselves from the grain deliveries and participating in communal meditation rituals. To give time and life more meaning the Vortex developed complex social rules whose violators are punished with artificial aging. The most extreme offenders are condemned to permanent old age and the status of \"Renegades\". But any Eternals who somehow manage to die, usually through some fatal accident, are almost...\n",

Castle's first application of this technology, dubbed Nanex, is a game called Society, which allows gamers to control a real person in a pseudo community (much like The Sims or Second Life). This allows players to engage in all manner of debauchery, such as deliberately injuring their \"characters\" and engaging in rough sex with random people. People who work as \"characters\" in Society (having nanites in their brain) are very well compensated.\nCastle amasses a fortune that surpasses that of Bill Gates virtually over-night, and soon follows up his success with Slayers, a first-person shooter where the \"characters\" in this game are death-row or life imprisoned inmates, who use real weapons to fight televised battles on specially created arenas. Any inmate who survives 30 matches earns his freedom. The player controls the character's movement, while the character decides when to shoot, and no communication is allowed between the two. The game is known for a lag problem, called the \"ping\", a small but dangerous delay between the player's command and character's action. John \"Kable\" Tillman is the crowd's favorite, having survived a record 27 matches, where all others have only managed to survive ten matches at most. He is exclusively controlled by Simon, a seventeen-year-old superstar gamer from a wealthy family.\nThe technology and the games are not without controversies, and an activist organization called \"Humanz\" claims that Castle will one day use Nanex to control people against their will. During a talk-show interview, Castle is confronted with questions about a potentially rigged vote which gave Castle control over the U.S prison system and allowed him to operate the Slayers game. In the middle of the broadcast, the network is hacked by the Humanz, which Castle finds amusing....\n",

When construction of an irrigation canal to the village is completed, Radha (Nargis), considered to be the \"mother\" of the village, is asked to inaugurate the canal. She remembers her past, when she was newly married.\nThe wedding between Radha and Shamu (Raaj Kumar) is paid for by Radha's mother-in-law, who borrows the money from the moneylender Sukhilala. The conditions of the loan are disputed, but the village elders decide in favour of the moneylender, after which Shamu and Radha are forced to pay three quarters of their crop as interest on the loan of â¹500 (valued at about US$105 in 1957).[a][b] While Shamu works to bring more of their rocky land into use, his arms are crushed by a boulder. Ashamed of his helplessness (being without arms) and humiliated by Sukhilala for living on the earnings of his wife, Shamu decides that he is of no use to his family and permanently leaves Radha and their three sons, walking to his own probable death by starvation. Soon after, Radha's youngest son and her mother-in-law die. A severe storm and the resulting flood destroys houses in the village and ruins the harvest. Sukhilala offers to save Radha and her sons if she trades her body to him for food. Radha vehemently refused his offer, but had to also lose her infant (her fourth son) to the atrocities of the storm. Although the villagers begin initially to evacuate the village, they decide to stay and rebuild it, persuaded by Radha.\nSeveral years later, Radha's two surviving children, Birju (Sunil Dutt) and Ramu (Rajendra Kumar), are young men. Birju, embittered since childhood by the demands of Sukhilala, takes out his frustrations by pestering the village girls, especially Sukhilala's daughter, Rupa. Ramu, by contrast, has a calmer temperament and is married soon after. Birju's anger finally becomes dangerous and, after being provoked, he attacks Sukhilala and his daughter and steals Radha's kangan (marriage bracelets) that were pawned with Sukhilala....\n",

Before Karnes can return to the U.S., a real-life example of his concern materializes when Tom Trevethan (Henri Vidon), an old fisherman, receives a lethal dose of radiation; his dying word is \"behemoth\". Later thousands of dead fish are washed ashore.\nKarnes and Bickford investigate the beach where the old man died, collecting samples which prove that radiation was the cause. Karnes begins to suspect that the \"behemoth\" that the old man described is some kind of large marine mammal that has been infected with radiation.\nA man, his son, and their dog are the next victims of the creature. A photo of the area reveals a huge foot-print of some prehistoric animal. Dr. Sampson (Jack MacGowran), a paleontologist, identifies the creature as a 'Paleosaurus', an aquatic dinosaur that emits an electric pulse, like an eel. Karnes believes that the dinosaur is saturated by radiation, which is transmitted by the electric pulse, resulting in the burns that killed the fishermen and other victims. The radiation is also slowly killing the dinosaur. According to Dr. Samson, the dying creature will leave the ocean depths to head up stream, seeking out the shallow waters where it was born; unfortunately death by radiation may not come soon enough to prevent the creature from wreaking havoc on London along the way.\nKarnes and Bickford try to persuade authorities to close the Thames, but the military believes their radar tracking systems will be enough to detect the behemoth and prevent it from getting near the city. Unfortunately, the dinosaur appears to be invisible to radar. Dr. Sampson and some other scientists spot it from a Royal Navy helicopter, but the radar equipment tracking the helicopter sees no sign of the beast, which destroys the helicopter with its radioactive emanations.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (October 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nIn a two-dimensional world called Flatland populated by living squares, triangles, circles and other two-dimensional shapes, it is three days until the celebration of the year 3000. A Square, attorney at law, struggles to instruct his grandson, A Hexagon, in the art of sight recognition. The lesson is interrupted by A Square's brother B, a clerk to President Circle, warning A to stay home during a meeting at the Senate of the Great Southern Republic of Flatland.\nThe Senate session has been called to discuss the increasing hostilities between the government and the Chromatist movement, led by Senator Chromatistes, an irregular dodecagon. The movement seeks legalization of the right of Flatlanders to color their sides as they see fit. Traditionally taboo, laws against it had been relaxed; this emboldened the Chromatists to demand legalization. The Great Southern Republic distinguishes itself from its enemy, the Northern Kingdom, by its stances on Chromatism and Irregulars along with a democratic government. Relaxing the laws has already been perceived as weakness by the Northern Kingdom who are massing on the borders.\nAgainst his brotherâs warning, A Square meets his new client, the first female charged as a Chromatist; on his way home he is caught in the melee leaving the Senate. President Circleâs soldiers killed Senator Chromatistes and his supporters, sparking a riot across the city. A Square just gets home safely, then barricades his family against the chaos for the night.\nOnce asleep, A Square dreams of visiting a one-dimensional world, Lineland, and attempts to convince the realm's ignorant king of a second dimension, but fails to make him see outside of his eternally straight line. A Square awakens to learn that the deadly riots originated in the Senate meeting that B Square was...\n",

There is no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime. What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record and to try to find one's way to the heart of the man...[8]\nThe film begins on the day of Gandhi's assassination on 30 January 1948.[7]:18â21 After an evening prayer, an elderly Gandhi is helped out for his evening walk to meet a large number of greeters and admirers. One of these visitors, Nathuram Godse, shoots him point blank in the chest. Gandhi exclaims, \"Oh, God!\" (\"HÄ Ram!\" historically), and then falls dead. The film then cuts to a huge procession at his funeral, which is attended by dignitaries from around the world.\nThe early life of Gandhi is not depicted in the film. Instead, the story flashes back 55 years to a life-changing event: in 1893, the 23-year-old Gandhi is thrown off a South African train for being an Indian sitting in a first-class compartment despite having a first-class ticket.[9] Realising the laws are biased against Indians, he then decides to start a nonviolent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa. After numerous arrests and unwelcome international attention, the government finally relents by recognising some rights for Indians.[10]\nAfter this victory, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence, (Swaraj, Quit India) from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a nonviolent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi's occasional imprisonment. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre is also depicted in the...\n",

The two men are soon joined in conversation by an old man at the bar claiming that America does, named O.W. Grant; the son of a leprechaun and a Cheyenne Indian.\nO.W. Grant, who is yet found near Interstate 60, wears a red bow tie, carries a pipe with mysterious powers in the shape of a monkey-head and grants people their wish, often with the macabre twist that the wish manifests exactly as it was worded.\nIn the opening credits, Grant (Gary Oldman), rides down a city street where a man (Michael J. Fox) opens his car door, causing Grant to fall from his bike and break his pipe. The bicycle is smashed when a truck runs over it. Grant, seemingly amused, asks him if he wished the event never happened. When the man says yes, green smoke billows from Grant's pipe and the scene begins again. This time, Grant safely avoids the car door. As he watches, the man gets out of his car and is crushed by the oncoming truck. Grant retorts, \"Some people just don't know what to wish for.\"\nThe story then switches over to Neal Oliver who works at a warehouse in St. Louis, Missouri, at night on the stocking crew that gets food ready to be delivered to local grocery stores. Although he has a rich family, and his dad works as a lawyer, Neal works the warehouse job to not have to rely on his family for spending money. While he aspires to become an artist, he does not have enough faith in his work, and his girlfriend is a psychology major who keeps analyzing him without offering any real support. He also has recurring dreams about a blonde-haired girl (Smart), whom...\n",

What Capetto doesn't know however is that there really is a shaggy, pop-eyed sea monster lurking in the very waters where he plans to do the dirty deed and that the creature may make his plan all too easy to pull off!\nWhen the monster's insatiable hunger upsets his scheme though, Capetto decides to sink his boat in 30 feet of water off the shore of a small Puerto Rican island and then retrieve the gold at a later time.

As punishment for his failure, Zophael kills the assassin and goes after Danyael himself with an extendable weapon with a blade that can be turned into a three-pronged hook. However, Danyael is protected by Gabriel, a now-human fallen angel who killed Danyael's father and performed many misdeeds. After being defeated by Danyael's mother, Gabriel was turned into a human as punishment. Having spent years as a human, he now realizes how wrong he was in the past.\nZophael convinces Danyael's girlfriend Maggie to work with him to stop Danyael, but when she becomes suspicious of his motives, she shoots the angel.

Hamilton and his assistant Chenne, who survive because they are away from the camp site, scour the area looking for clues and remains of their team.\nMeanwhile, another research team is inbound, this one a crew of college anthropology students with no idea of what they're in for. The students, Seth, Amy, Greg, Sydney, Josh, and Dani, are flown into a remote region of the Thai jungle, and picked up by a guide who drives them deeper into bush.

He heads back the way he came, leaving the students to march forth into the unknown. They walk until they reach the end of trail and set up camp. As evening sets in, noises from the jungle raise suspicion until a set of glowing green eyes can be seen close by, watching. Just before the unknown creature attacks, Chenne arrives with a flare that scares off the unseen menace.\nChenne escorts the students to the relative safety of Professor Hamilton's camp, and the following day they meet the obsessed man and somewhat learn of his mission and their purpose.

His favorite simian co-worker is a chimpanzee named Pericles. With a deadly electromagnetic storm approaching the station, a small space pod piloted by Pericles is used to probe the storm. Pericles's pod heads into the storm and disappears. Against his commanding officer's orders, Leo takes a second pod and goes in pursuit of Pericles. Entering the storm, Leo loses contact with the Oberon and crashes on a planet called Ashlar in the year 5021. He discovers that the world is ruled by humanoid apes who can speak human language and treat human beings as slaves.\nLeo comes across a female chimpanzee named Ari, who protests the awful treatment humans receive. Ari decides to buy Leo and a female slave named Daena to have them work as servants in the house of her father, Senator Sandar. Leo escapes his cage and frees other humans.

This gives Finlander an advantage but also means the Soviets will be more desperate. Also aboard the ship are Ensign Ralston (James MacArthur), an inexperienced young officer constantly being criticised by his captain for small errors, and Lieutenant Commander Chester Potter, USNR (Martin Balsam), the ship's new doctor, who is a reservist recently recalled to active duty.\nMunceford is aboard in order to photograph life on a Navy destroyer, but his real interest is Captain Finlander, who was recently passed over for promotion to rear admiral. Munceford is curious whether a comment made by Finlander regarding the American intervention in Cuba is the reason for his nonpromotion, perhaps betraying veiled aggression. He is treated with mounting hostility by the captain because he is seen as a civilian putting his nose where it does not belong and because he disagrees with Finlander's decision to continue with an unnecessary and dangerous confrontation. Finlander is hostile to anyone who is not involved in the hunt, including the doctor, who will not stand up to the captain but advises that the pressure on the crew be reduced.\nThe crew becomes increasingly fatigued by the unrelenting pursuit during which the captain demands full attention to the instruments.

Xerxes finally reaches a cave and bathes in an otherworldly liquid, emerging as the 8-feet tall \"god-King\". He returns to Persia and declares war on Greece to avenge his father.\nAs Xerxes's forces advance towards Thermopylae, Themistocles meets with the council and convinces them to provide him with a fleet to engage the Persians at the sea. Themistocles (the Athenian general) then travels to Sparta to ask King Leonidas for help, but is informed by Dilios that Leonidas is consulting the Oracle, and Gorgo is reluctant to side with Athens. Themistocles later reunites with his old friend Scyllas, who infiltrated the Persian troops and learned Artemisia was born Greek, but defected to Persia as her family was raped and murdered by Greek hoplites and she was taken as a sex slave, and subsequently left for dead in the streets. She was rescued and adopted by a Persian emissary. Her lust for vengeance gained the attention of King Darius and he made her a naval commander after she killed many of his enemies. Themistocles also learns that Leonidas has marched to fight the Persians with only 300 men.\nThemistocles leads his fleet of fifty warships and several thousand men, which include Scyllas, Scyllas' son Calisto and Themistocles' right-hand man Aeskylos to the Aegean Sea, starting the Battle of Artemisium. They ram their ships into the Persian ships, charge them, slaughtering several soldiers before retreating from the sinking Persian ships.

A mysterious woman looking to procure the priceless gem has a tete-a-tete with a man regarding price. Suddenly, Clouseau (having disappeared inexplicably on a plane flight in the previous film) bursts in. The woman shoots the man, then points the gun at Clouseau. His fate is a mystery. Meanwhile, his former superior, Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), is pressured to oversee Operation Paragon and utilize Interpol's fictitious Huxley Huxley 600 computer Aldous to find the world's greatest detective to solve the crime.\nWhat the world at large does not realize is that Clouseau was actually an inept fool whose cases were solved more through luck than actual detective genius, and that his accident-prone incompetence led Dreyfus to a series of nervous breakdowns. Anxious never to see or hear from his nemesis again, Dreyfus sabotages the computer to select the world's worst detective. This turns out to be Sergeant Clifton Sleigh (Ted Wass), an incompetent officer of the New York Police Department.\nSleigh, who is descended from a long line of cops, sees the case as an opportunity to prove his worth.

He is then forced to face his destiny. As a Nephilim, he has some of the angels' abilities, such as regeneration, and can only be killed if his heart is removed. One night, a blind assassin shoots Danyael as he preaches before a crowd, but the assassin is driven off before he can take out Danyael's heart. As punishment for his failure, Zophael kills the assassin and goes after Danyael himself with an extendable weapon with a blade that can be turned into a three-pronged hook. However, Danyael is protected by Gabriel, a now-human fallen angel who killed Danyael's father and performed many misdeeds. After being defeated by Danyael's mother, Gabriel was turned into a human as punishment. Having spent years as a human, he now realizes how wrong he was in the past.\nZophael convinces Danyael's girlfriend Maggie to work with him to stop Danyael, but when she becomes suspicious of his motives, she shoots the angel. It has little effect on Zophael, and he tells her what he is. Frightened and confused, Maggie agrees to help him, and the two catch up to Danyael on a Native American reservation, where he is going to confront Pyriel, another angel who wants to overthrow God.

After parting from Mary, Danyael is attacked by Zophael, crashing Maggie's truck and badly injuring her. He then faces off against Danyael in battle and seemingly defeats him by impaling his chest with a motorcycle tailpipe, but the angel gets back up and uses his weapon to impale Danyael from behind.

In turn, Bud reluctantly follows the advice of his father, Ace (Pat Hingle), who suggests that he find another kind of girl with whom to satisfy his desires. Bud's parents are ashamed of his older sister, Ginny (Barbara Loden), a flapper and party girl who is sexually promiscuous, smokes, drinks, and has recently been brought back from Chicago, where her parents had a marriage annulled to someone who married her solely for her money. Rumors in town, however, have been swirling that the real reason was that she had an abortion. Being so disappointed in their daughter, Bud's parents \"pin all their hopes\" on Bud, pressuring him to attend Yale University. The emotional pressure is too much for Bud, who suffers a physical breakdown and nearly dies from pneumonia.\nBud knows one of the girls in high school, Juanita (Jan Norris) who is willing to become sexually involved with him, and he has a liaison with her. A short while later, depressed because of Bud ending their relationship, Deanie acts out by modeling herself after Bud's sister, Ginny.

The film begins with them arriving on a bus, assembling their props and getting into costume. One of the group is surrounded by the others, puts on a white robe and emerges as Jesus (\"Overture\").\nJudas (Anderson) is worried about Jesus' popularity; he is being hailed as the Son of God, but Judas feels he is just a man who is beginning to believe his own propaganda and fears the consequences of their growing movement (\"Heaven on Their Minds\"). The other disciples badger Jesus for information about his plans for the future, but Jesus will not give them any (\"What's the Buzz?\"). Judas' arrival and subsequent declaration that Jesus should not associate with Mary dampens the mood (\"Strange Thing Mystifying\"). Angrily, Jesus tells Judas that he should leave Mary alone, because his slate is not clean. He then accuses all the apostles of not caring about him. That night at the Temple, Caiaphas is worried that the people will crown Jesus as king, which the Romans will take for an uprising. Annas tries to allay his fears, but he finally sees Caiaphas' point and suggests that he convene the council and explain his fears to them; Caiaphas agrees (\"Then We Are Decided\"). As Jesus and his apostles settle for the night, Mary soothes him with some expensive ointment, but Judas says that the money spent should have been given to the poor. Jesus rebukes him again, telling him that the poor will be there always but Jesus will not (\"Everything's Alright\").\nThe next day at the Temple of Jerusalem, the council of the priests discuss their fears about Jesus. Caiaphas tells them that there is only one solution: like John the Baptist, Jesus must be executed for the sake of the nation (\"This Jesus Must Die\"). Jesus and his followers joyfully arrive in Jerusalem, but Caiaphas orders Jesus to disband the crowd for fear of a riot. Jesus refuses and speaks to the crowd (\"Hosanna\").

On his orders, they steal high-tech communications equipment. Despite the intervention of Terry McGinnis (Bruce Wayne's successor as Batman), the Joker escapes. Bruce insists that the Joker must be an impostor, claiming to have witnessed the Joker's death after their last battle. Unwilling to let Terry face the Jokerâimpostor or notâBruce demands that he return the Batsuit, to which he reluctantly complies. Later, Terry and his girlfriend Dana are attacked by the Jokerz at a nightclub. At the same time, the Joker ambushes and attacks Bruce in the Batcave, leaving him for dead. Terry defeats the Jokerz, and Dana is taken to the hospital for her injuries. Terry rushes to Wayne Manor, and finds Bruce near-dead from the Joker's trademark toxin. Terry quickly administers an antidote, and tends to Bruce with the help of Barbara Gordon.\nAt Terry's insistence, Barbara reluctantly tells him what really happened to the Joker. Decades earlier, after Nightwing (Dick Grayson) moved to the adjoining city of BlÃ¼dhaven to fight crime on his own, the Joker and Harley Quinn kidnapped Tim Drake, Dick's successor as Robin, disfigured him to look like the Joker, and tortured him for three weeks, at which point Tim revealed Batman's secrets. After hearing Joker taunting Tim, Batman snaps and fights him only to end up stabbed and weakened.

A substantial percentage of the population was wiped out by a devastating viral pandemic twenty years previously. Amidst the resulting chaos and general panic, democracy collapsed and a totalitarian cabal seized power. After moving the seat of government to Boston, the new dictatorship outlawed ownership and use of all automobiles, boats, and aircraft, on the pretext (later proven false) that an even bigger crisis, the exhaustion of fossil fuel supplies, was imminent. The loss of other personal freedoms followed, and surveillance cameras now monitor private citizens' every move.\nIn Boston, Franklyn Hart (Majors), a former race car driver who lost his family to the plague, is a spokesman for the mass transit system. Publicly, he deplores the selfishness of private vehicle ownership and exalts the virtues of public transportation; privately, he is barely able to contain his contempt for the oppressive, autocratic bureaucracy and the dismal party line that he is compelled to promote.\nYears before, as private vehicles were being confiscated, Hart sequestered his race carâan orange Porsche roadsterâin a secret compartment beneath his basement.

We only see the Justice making a tape recording and then shooting himself. Shortly after the suicide, the body of Elizabeth Quinn, a file clerk at the Justice Department, is found floating in the Potomac River, and Carl Wayne Anderson (Liam Neeson), a homeless, deaf-mute Vietnam veteran, is arrested for the crime, based almost entirely on the fact that he was seen sleeping in Quinn's car the night of her murder. Kathleen Riley (Cher) is the beleaguered D.C. public defender assigned to represent Anderson.\nThe car was abandoned in a desolate K Street parking lot. Anderson, it is eventually revealed, found the car unlocked and was just looking for a warm place to sleep since it was the dead of winter. But since he was homeless, had no alibi, and was also found in possession of Quinn's wallet, he was arrested for her murder.\nRiley finds it difficult to communicate with Anderson, a deaf-mute. Over time, she begins to penetrate his hard exterior and he tries to cooperate with her efforts to mount a defense for him.\nAn agribusiness lobbyist who normally works on Capitol Hill, Eddie Sanger (Dennis Quaid), is approved as a member of the jury by Riley despite his attempt to be excused. Sanger begins investigating the details of the murder himself, eventually teaming up with Riley beyond the observation of the trial's suspicious judge.\nSanger also keeps busy in his work as a lobbyist on Capitol Hill, including his efforts to win passage of a bill by seducing a Congresswoman.\nAs the investigation by Riley, with unethical assistance from Sanger, intensifies, they begin focusing on Deputy Attorney General Paul Gray (Philip Bosco).

Moments after the game begins, he leaves the game and goes after Scarlet, abandoning his hopes of going to college and becoming a professional basketball player.\nTwo decades later, Mike (Matthew Perry), now thirty-seven years old, finds his life stalled. Scarlet (Leslie Mann), now his wife and mother of their two children, has separated from him due to him blaming her for his regrets about abandoning his future, forcing him to move in with his geeky, yet extremely wealthy, best friend since high school, Ned Gold (Thomas Lennon). At his job, there comes another reason for his frustration: due to his lack of higher education and since he is significantly older than most of his co-workers, he is passed over for a promotion he deserves in favor of a much younger worker. He quits his job and his high school-age children, seventeen-year-old Maggie (Michelle Trachtenberg) and sixteen-year-old Alex (Sterling Knight) want nothing to do with him. Later, while visiting his high school to reminisce, an encounter with a mysterious janitor (Brian Doyle-Murray) transforms Mike back into his seventeen-year-old self.\nMike then enrolls in high school posing as Mark Gold, Ned's son, and plans to go to college with a basketball scholarship. As he befriends his bullied son and discovers that his daughter has a boyfriend, Stan (Hunter Parrish), who does not respect her and frequently torments Alex, Mike comes to believe that his mission is to help them. He meets Stan, the captain of the basketball team, and embarrasses him in front of the whole school after Stan insults Alex. Later, in Sex Education class while the teacher is handing out condoms to the students in a basket, Stan turns to Mike and refuses to give him any, saying that he does not need them, causing quiet laughter among the class.

Encountering the Baron Hartog (Douglas Wilmer), a vampire hunter out to avenge the death of his sister, the girl is identified as a vampire and decapitated. Many years later, a dark-haired lady leaves her daughter Marcilla (Ingrid Pitt) in the care of General von Spielsdorf (Peter Cushing) and his family in Styria. Marcilla quickly befriends the General's niece, Laura (Pippa Steel). Laura subsequently suffers nightmares that she is being attacked, and dies of a gradual sickness; whereupon Marcilla departs.\nFaking a carriage break-down, Marcilla's mother leaves her (now using the alias 'Carmilla') at the residence of a Mr. Morton, where Carmilla befriends and seduces Morton's daughter Emma (Madeline Smith). Thereafter Emma suffers nightmares of penetration over the heart, and her breast shows tiny wounds. Emma's governess, Madame Perrodot (Kate O'Mara), becomes Carmilla's accomplice. The butler and a doctor suspect them; but Carmilla kills each one. A mysterious man in black watches events from a distance, smiling (his presence is never explained). Having killed the butler, Carmilla takes Emma prisoner and departs. When Madame Perrodot begs Carmilla to take her too, Carmilla kills her. Emma is rescued by a young man named Carl (Jon Finch), and Carmilla flees to her ancestral castle, now a ruin. All this coincides with the arrival of the General, who brings a now-aged Baron Hartog. They find Carmilla's grave, which reveals that her true name is Mircalla Karnstien, where the General forces a stake into Carmilla's heart, and cuts off her head. Thereupon Carmilla's portrait on the wall shows a fanged skeleton instead of a beautiful young woman.\n",

If it's un-answerable, please output \"No answer\".\n\nQuestion: What is the relationship between Matt and Allison?\nMovie plot title: On Hostile Ground\nMovie plot: Corbett stars as Matt Andrews, a geologist who is asked to investigate why there have been two large sinkholes affecting the city of New Orleans. Jessica Steen plays his girlfriend Allison Beauchamp, assistant to the Mayor, who has to decide whether the problems with the sinkholes will spread far enough to require that the remainder of Mardi Gras be cancelled, which would be an economic disaster to the city.Matt has a number of personal issues because of a disaster which happened at a mine he was advising on its operations. Although cleared of responsibility for the accident, he still blames himself, which may be causing him to be overcautious. Matt admits the potential problem of the sinkholes becoming so serious as to endanger the city could occur next week, or not for three hundred years. Based on the lack of real evidence of immediate danger, and because some evidence that she should have received has been destroyed by the mayor's political flack, Allison has decided not to close the festival, only to have the disaster metastasize, like a cancer devouring the city's underground.The only answer is to obtain a binary liquid which when combined produces a foam that will fill the huge sinkhole cavern. The foam will expand to hundreds of times its size, and becomes as hard as concrete. Due to an emergency, while Matt is underground inspecting the caverns, he becomes partially trapped, and has to ask to have the foam started (which will kill him if he can't find an escape) because if they don't start the flow of the liquid immediately, the ground underneath downtown New Orleans will collapse similar to the effects of soil liquefaction and thousands to tens of thousands of people will be injured or killed. The last few minutes of the film become a race against time as Matt attempts to find an exit before the foam overwhelms him.The film points to an event that would happen five years after the movie was made. Matt points out the sinkholes, if they do fail and open up, could be as serious a disaster to the city...\n",

My son Henry and I were shopping in a neighborhood market. Henry was busy weighing each new bag of vegetables I selected. I gave him a bag of potatoes and he walked over to the scale and waited in line. Suddenly, a man rushed over from behind, and stepped before him, hitting him out of the way. Henry looked shocked and scared. Seeing this I left my shopping cart and walked over to Henry, saying loudly, \"Are you OK, honey? I saw what that man did to you. That was very, very wrong.\"\nWhen the man finished weighing his bag, his sudden turning around made all his onions fall to the ground. The three of us stood there, frozen for a moment. And then I bent down on my hands and knees and started collecting onions. After I handed the onions to the man, he accepted them and put them into his bag. After Henry and I picked up all the onions, the man walked away without saying anything. We didn't discuss the event until we got back in the car.\nOn the way back home, Henry said through tears, \"Mommy, I've a frustrating day. That man cut right in front of me. And we had to help him pick up his onions! Why did we do that? That didn't make any sense!\"\nI took a deep breath and said, \"Henry, that man seemed to have a very bad mood today. We should forgive him. I was also angry with the man for treating you rudely. I really wanted to kick him. But doing that doesn't make any sense. If we hadn't helped him, we might have felt good for a moment, but then I bet we would have felt really sorry for a long time. You and I have a lot of love to share. Maybe that man doesn't have much. People who behave badly still need love.\"\nA cheerful smile appeared on Henry's face. It was a smile of promise kept. It was the best smile I had ever seen. It was a good moment. It may have been my best mommy moment ever.\nQuestion: What can we infer from the passage?\nOptions: A: The author was not angry at all with what the man had done.\nB: The man was very sorry for what he had done to Henry.\nC: At last, Henry learned a very valuable life lesson from the event.\nD: Henry didn't help the author pick up the onions for the man.\n",

Clever researchers may be considered too young to have \"any right\" to present findings that do not agree with knowledge and wisdom of their elders.\nThe American is trained from children to question, analyze and search. \"Go look it up for yourself\", a child will be told. School tasks are designed to demand the use of a wide range of materials. An assignment to \"write a paper on the world's supply of sugar\" will send even a young child in search of completely unfamiliar ideas. Even in the primary grades, children are taught to use libraries, and to search for new ideas. By the time they are 14, 15, and 16, many young scholars are making original and valuable contributions in all fields of science. Industry is so aware of this resource that each year, through national competitions, it offers tremendous awards among teenagers to seek out the brilliant minds across the country.\nAs seen by members of other nations, this emphasis on questioning and searching is bad for young people's \"manners\". Foreigners often feel great \"lack of respect\" in our youth. Foreign visitors are often surprised and frequently annoyed to find junior staff members \"daring\" to challenge older ones or argue points with them; they do not always like it when these young men make detailed but often revolutionary suggestions. One's own plans, reports of analyses may be looked through in detail---perhaps even challenged---by a young person. This is not to be considered a loss of face; nor is it a sign of \"no confidence\". Our whole approach to research is different.

People's capacity to fully understand, reason, organize, solve problems, display emotional intelligence, learn, communicate and think abstractly is outstanding. It is believed to be much more emphasized   nowadays, when bright folks are normally one level higher than everyone else.\nNowadays many people are of the view that a high intelligence quotient (IQ) is an excellent assistance in pulling through life. Statistics reveal that whatever activity enabling the brain to function and operate, no matter whether in the form of difficulties or other obstacles   that can be overcome by this specific body area, has a positive effect on it.\nSo every time you are making full use of your mind for right answers in a quick crossword or if you are answering difficult riddles, you might be, in fact, raising the probabilities of increasing your intelligence. You could play effective brain games like crosswords, chess, riddles, puzzles, Internet games, word games and other games. These are useful in raising your intelligence primarily because they let you think in a different way as you make an effort to uncover answers to certain problems. Aside from this, this form of brain training continually encourages the brain to function and widen its capacity to concentrate and learn.\nNeedless to say, you've to make sure that you make the most of these brain exercises by not cheating yourself. Lastly, if you progress to a much more complicated level, try your best to answer difficult problems with no hints or clues so that you are able to further force your brain to work on its own.\nQuestion: According to the text, through continuous brain training, people can   _  .\nOptions: A: learn a certain skill quickly\nB: become a confident person\nC: communicate with others well\nD: concentrate in their class\n",

For what more could you ask than comradeship during the peaks and valleys of life? To whom else but a close, valuable friend can you show off your successes and complain about your failures or losses?\nWhat is a \"good friend\"? How is he best described? Well, it has been my observation that although many will cry with you, few can sincerely rejoice   with you. Therefore, in my opinion, a good friend is one who can enjoy your successes without envy; one who can say, \"That was wonderful! You can do it again, even better if you want!\" and mean it.\n. Even the closest of friendships often cannot resist such pressure and fail. No wonder many minor friendships go down day by day for the same reason.\nA person of good character and sound moral, of honor and humor, of courage and belief is a friend to be sought and treasured -- for there are few. Too often we hear, \"If you can count your good friends on more than one hand, consider yourself blessed.\"\nWhat makes a friendship last? Well, I don't know all the answers, but one of my observations is that most good friends usually have similar tastes. They generally like and dislike many of the same things. There also usually seems to exist a similarity of personality types -- especially in the fundamental values of life such as honesty, sincerity, loyalty, and dependability. More often than not, birds of a feather do fly together. I don't think it matters a lot whether one prefers jazz or hockey to another's Mozart or ballet. Much other matters far more: relying, sharing, giving, getting, enjoying; a sympathetic ear always there; criticism when it can help; praise -- even if only because it would help. With not many people on this earth will you find this much in common. When you find one, hang on to him, for a good friend found is a rare treasure.\nQuestion: According to the passage, which of the following plays the LEAST important role in a long-lasting friendship?\nOptions: A: Hobbies.\nB: Tastes.\nC: Personality.\nD: Sympathy.\n",

A study showed that 25% of young children feel they couldn't live any more if you took away their name. Another study shows that about one third of all young people wish their parents had given them a different name.\nIn many cultures, there are special ideas about how to choose a name. For example, many people choose a name that has been in their family for many years. It tells the child where he or she has come from.\nChoosing a good name isn't easy. Many parents search books that tell them the meanings of names. They could choose a name that carries a message. For example, Edith means \"valuable gift\". Amanda means \"love\". And Fara means \"joy\".\nNames like these tell family and friends how happy they are with their new baby. Other names can say something about the events during the birth of the child. In Africa, a first born son may have the name Mosi and the name Ama means \"born on Saturday\".\nBut can our names influence our lives? Some experts say that they can, but others disagree. Is every girl called Malak like an angel? Is every boy called Curitis polite? And is every girl called Mahira quick and full of energy? No parent can tell what kind of person their child will grow up to be. Just because parents name a boy Fahim, it doesn't mean he will be clever.

Many thought it was just a trick to make more money. But then came Avatar, the first must-see movie in 3D.\nBut since Avatar, 3D cinema has struggled. In 2010, several 3D movies bombed at the box office. And by late 2010, Some people said the technology was dead. Of course, this isn't the first time Hollywood has struggled with new technology. Although sound was added to movies in the late 1920s, it took audiences time to get used to the new technology. But in the end, sound and color became the standard. James Cameron, director of Avatar, thinks we're going through the same process with 3D.\nSome say cinemas are charging too much for 3D movies. In the US, seeing a 3D movie can cost up to $7.5 more than seeing it in 2D. Also, a recent study at California State University found audiences don't actually enjoy movies in 3D any more than in 2D. Walter Murch , a famous movie editor, wrote in 2011 that human beings have no ability to process 3D images. Watching a 3D movie confuses our brain and this is why some people get headaches.\nBut James Cameron disagrees. In fact, he recently predicted that in five years all movies will be in 3D. And there are signs that 3D is fighting back. More 3D movies were put on the market in 2012 than ever before. The Lion King 3D recently made over US $150 million at the box office, and Cameron's Titanic 3D made even more.\nWho knows what the future holds for 3D? Steven Spielberg recently said, 'Tm hoping 3D gets to a point where people dorft notice it. Because then it just becomes another tool and helps tell a story.\"\nQuestion: The example of sound and color is used mainly to show that  _  .\nOptions: A: Hollywood tends to absorb what is new\nB: 3D technology takes time to be accepted\nC: Hollywood struggles with new technology\nD: high technology helps to make better movies\n",

He clapped loudly. \"You're looking strong. Keep going--go, go, go!\"\nYou bet I'm looking strong, I thought, as I followed my younger sister, Laura. I just got started. She had been diligently clocking eight-minute miles since the race had begun downtown. Initially in the middle of a pack, which was several thousand people, she had been steadily passing other runners for the past 10 miles or so. We were now on the relatively steep rise to the St. Cecelia Bridge. Once we crossed, we would begin heading back into town, running along the east side of the Rincon River. Laura had asked me to run the most difficult section of the marathon with her. Not having trained for anything more challenging than a quick walk, and with no experience running in organized events, I figured I might be good for two or three miles.\nUp ahead, steel drums were playing. A group of drummers was beating their drums, chanting, and encouraging us with their music and smiles. Crossing the bridge, I recalled the advice in the Marathon Handbook. During my preview of the route, it had seemed like a babyish thing to do. But now it seemed like a fine idea, and I spat magnificently over the side of the bridge.\n\"I read the handbook, too!\" said a woman behind me, who also let loose over the side of the bridge. We had now started a chain reaction of bridge spitters. It was quite a sight, but I had other things to occupy my attention, namely the back of Laura's sweater.\nEasing off the bridge, and heading south on Avila Boulevard, Laura and I found our pace together again. Here we could hang to the left of the group and enjoy some brief conversation. \"You keeping up okay?\" she asked. Being her older brother, and therefore unable to admit weakness, I nodded convincingly.\n\"Hey, Lee!\" yelled a waving man...\nQuestion: Why was Lee glad he wore a tie-dyed shirt?\nOptions: A: It helped people locate him easily.\nB: The shirt brought him good luck.\nC: It added to the festival atmosphere.\nD: The shirt was a favorite of Laura's.\n",

The basic rate is 28 Yuan ($4.22) per person, plus an additional 4 Yuan an hour. The hotel also offers a package of 68 Yuan for 10 hours and 88 Yuan for 24 hours.\nAll of the capsules are imported from Japan where capsule hotels originated,and each is equipped with independent sockets, clocks, lights, TV and wireless Internet service. The hotel also has a public lavatory ,shower room, smoking room and shared guest room.\n\"This is a huge bargain compared with other budget hotels in Shanghai,\" said Ta Zan, the owner of the hotel. Ta used to stay at capsule hotels in Tokyo during his undergraduate years and worked at a capsule hotel while he was doing his MBA in Japan in 2005, so he knows how they work and how to make guests feel comfortable.\nHe based the hotel on capsule hotels in Japan but he has made some special changes based on Chinese guests' habits. \"In Japan capsule hotels are usually equipped with bathtubs, but in China people are more willing to take a shower, so we have the shower room,\" he said.

Although science has made big steps in making food more fit to eat, it has, at the same time, made many foods unfit to eat. Some research has shown that perhaps eighty percent of human illness is related to food and forty percent of cancer is related to food as well. That food is related to illness is not a new discovery. In 1945, some researchers realized that things commonly used to keep colour in meats and other food additives caused cancer.\nYet, these additives remain in our food, and it is difficult to know which things on the wrappings of foods are helpful or harmful. The additives which we eat are not all so direct. Farmers often give penicillin to their animals, and because of this, penicillin has been found in the milk of cows. Sometimes similar tings are supplied to animals not for their health, but just to make a profit.\nThe farmers are simply trying to fatten the animals in order to get a higher price on the market.

It promotes home cooking, and the use of fresh, unprocessed produce. It was founded as reaction to the popularity of unhealthy fast food. It also encourages people to buy food from local businesses, rather than large supermarkets.\nThe movement began in 1986. at that time, McDonald's wanted to open a restaurant in the centre of Rome (Italy). Food writer Carlo Perini, along with others, was against this. So, the Slow Food Organization was born. Today, it has overt 100,00 members in 132 countries. And its symbol is one of the world's slowest moving creatures, the snail. The organization's website explains, \"The snail was chosen because it moves slowly, and calmly eats its way through life.\"\nBut Slow Food isn't just about the food we eat. It's also about how we eat it. Slow foodies say that in our fast - food world with very little time, we've forgotten that eating should be a social activity. They believe families should eat together and talk, rather than watch TV with their dinner while sitting in front of it. In fact, research has shown that if children grow up in a family that eats together at the table, they are more likely to do well in school, and less likely to have behavioral problems or devel op eating disorders.\nAnd there's more! Slow Food has sparked an entire Slow Food Movement. This encourages people to slow down the pace of their busy lives. And now, within the movement, there's Slow Money, Slow Travel, Slow Parenting, Slow Art and Slow Media, among many others. In 1999 The World Institute of Slowness was formed. One of the Institute's slogans is a quotation by the famous American actress Mae West. She said, \"Everything worth doing in life, is worth doing slowly.\" Do you agree? No need to answer straight away. Have a long hard think about it. Take your time. And get back to us when you can.\nQuestion: If you are a member of the Slow Food Organization, you may   _  .\nOptions: A: react to fast food slowly\nB: buy food from large supermarkets\nC: like to cook at home\nD: like the animal of snails\n",

But the historically high price of products is making it an even bigger drag on the bottom line.\nRestaurants, colleges, hospitals and other institutions are compensating for the rising costs of waste in novel ways. Some are tracking their trash with software systems, making food in smaller packages or trying to compost (......) and cut down on trash-hauling costs.\n\"We have all come to work with this big elephant in the middle of kitchen, and the elephant is this 'It's okay to waste' belief system,\" said Andrew Shackman, president of LeanPath, a company that helps restaurants cut back food waste.\nThe interest in cutting food waste \"has just rocketed in the last six to nine months,\" he said.\nRoughly 30 percent of food in the United States goes to waste, costing some $48 billion annually, according to a Stockholm International Water Institute study. A University of Arizona study estimated that 40 to 50 percent of food in the United States is wasted. Wholesale food costs have risen more than 8 percent this year, the biggest jump in decades, according to the National Restaurant Association.\nFreshman students at Virginia Tech were surprised this year when the two of the campus' biggest dining halls to find there were no trays.\n\"You have to go back and get your dishware and your drink, but it's not that different,\" said Caitlin Mewborn, a freshman. \"It's not a big trouble. You take less food, and you don't eat more than you should.\"\nGetting rid of trays has cut food waste by 38 percent at the dining halls, said Denny Cochrane, manager of Virginia Tech's sustainability program. Before the program began, students often grabbed whatever looked good at the buffet  , only to find at the table that their eyes were bigger than their stomachs, he said.\nQuestion: The author mentions Virginia Tech as an example to support the idea that   _  .\nOptions: A: food waste has been a long-lasting chronic problem\nB: novel ways are being applied to cutting food waste\nC: colleges are truly the biggest source of food waste\nD: the \"It's okay to waste\" belief system is influential\n",

So, if you set your goals and strive to get there, it should be assumed that you are moving toward your goal no matter what you are doing, right?\nWhen watching a football game, one of those great high school starter games, set to determine who starts when the real games begin, I noticed the coach called \"defense\" only when the team was \"protecting\" their goal. As long as the team was fighting for more ground they played \"offense  \". Along the same lines, I've heard the phrase, \"a strong defense requires a good offense.\" Simply put, if you concentrate more on gaining ground than on protecting your goals, your accomplishments will be greater.

And it can happen anywhere.\nIn 1999, 11-year-old Kevin Stephan was a bat boy for his younger brother's Little League team in Lancaster, New York. It was an early evening in late July. Kevin was standing on the grass away from the plate, where another youngster was warming up for the next game. Swinging his bat back and forth, and giving it all the power an elementary school kid could give, the boy brought the bat back hard and hit Kevin in the chest. His heart stopped.\nWhen Kevin fell to the ground, the mother of one of the players rushed out of the stands to his aid. Penny Brown hadn't planned to be there that day, but at the last minute,she had changed  her shift   at the hospital, and she was given the night off. Penny bent over the senseless boy, his face already starting to turn blue, and giving CPR, breathing into his mouth and giving chest compressions  . And he came to life.\nAfter his recovery, he became a volunteer junior firefighter, learning some of the emergency first-aid techniques that had saved his life. He studied hard in school and was saving money for college by working as a dishwasher in a local restaurant in his spare time.\nKevin, now 17, was working in the kitchen when he heard people screaming, customers in confusion, employees rushing toward a table. He hurried into the main room and saw a woman there, her face turning blue, her hands at her throat.

Then, using skills he'd first learned in Scouts, the food that was trapped in the woman's throat was freed. The color began to return to her face.\n\"The food was stuck.

There's the Gaelic   language in Scotland and a few people speak Cornish  in the southwest of England, but the most widely spoken language in the UK besides English is Welsh.\nPerhaps the first Welsh word you'll see on the road into Wales is ARAF. There's a helpful English translation next to it -- SLOW. As you can see, Welsh looks quite different from English. It sounds very different, too. Welsh looks and sounds so different from English because it's a Celtic language. Celtic cultures still exist around the edges of the UK -- in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and also in parts of France. For hundreds of years, almost everyone in Wales spoke Welsh, but nowadays there are about 600 thousand Welsh speakers -- around 20% of the population.\nSo is Welsh dying out? Not at all! Nowadays, all school children in Wales study Welsh and many choose to go to an all Welsh-speaking school. You can get public information in Welsh, speak Welsh in court or take a course at university in Welsh.

Nobody dares any longer to defend the old system, the learning of lessons parrot-fashion, the grammar-with-a-whip system, which was good enough for our grandparents. The theories of modem psychology have stepped in to argue that we must understand the need of children. Children are not just small adults; they are children who must be respected as much.\nWell, you may say, this is as it should be, a good idea. But think further. What happens? \"Education\" becomes the responsibility not of teachers, but of psychologists  . What happens then? Teachers worry too much about the psychological implications   of their lessons, and forget about the subjects themselves. If a child dislikes a lesson, the teacher feels that it is his fault, not the child's. So teachers worry whether history is \"relevant\" to modern young children. And do they dare to recount stories about violence? Or will this make the children themselves violent? Can they tell their classes about children of different races, or will this encourage racial hatred? Why teach children to write grammatical sentences? Verbal expression is better. Sums? Arithmetic? No: Real-life mathematical situations are more understandable.\nYou see, you can go too far. Influenced by educational theorists, who have nothing better to do than to write books about their ideas, teachers leave their teacher-training colleges filled with grand, psychological ideas about children and their needs. They make elaborate, sophisticated (,) preparations and try out their \"modem methods\" on the long-suffering children. Since one \"modem method\" rapidly replaces another the poor kids will have had a good bellyful by the time they leave school.

Now we have 6montholds in music classes and swimming classes. Parents fear that if other children are attending these classes,they will be holding their own children back if they do not enroll,too.\nThe other extreme,simply taking a laissez-faire approach and letting children do--or refuse to do--whatever they want,is not the answer either,of course.\nDr Taylor emphasizes that parents need to push their children based on what is best for the children,not what is best for themselves. If children understand that an activity is in their best interests,then they will accept it,he finds.\nDr Taylor and other family experts remain pessimistic  about the possibilities for widespread social change. \"The force of our popular culture,driven by money and superficial   values,cannot be resisted,\" he says. But change can take place at a \"microlevel\",in families and schools.\nWhen changes do occur,the rewards can benefit everyone in the family. One mother supporting this new approach toward parenting mentions the advantages her family experienced after her children cut back on activities. \"The biggest thing is that since we have done this,we are rested,\" she says. \"Not only are our kids rested,because they're not in a ton of stuff,but my husband and I are rested,because we're not driving them everywhere.

Joseph Merlin was a man of ideas and dreams. People called him a dreamer.\nOne day Merlin received an invitation to attend a fancy dress ball. He was very pleased and a little excited. As the day of the party came near, Merlin began to think how to make a grand entrance at the party. He had an idea. He thought he would get a lot of attention if he could skate into the room.\nMerlin tried different ways to make himself roll. Finally, he decided to put two wheels under each shoe. These were the first roller skates. Merlin was very proud of his invention and dreamed of arriving at the party on wheels while playing the violin.\nOn the night of the party Merlin rolled into the room playing his violin. Everyone was astonished to see him. There was just one problem. Merlin had no way to stop his roller skates. He rolled on and on. Suddenly, he ran into a huge mirror that was hanging on the wall.

Electric cars users may also eventually be able to charge their vehicles wirelessly using the same technology according to Fujitsu, which presented a system at an Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers Conference at Osaka Prefecture University.\nClaiming to be the world's first of its kind, the technology works on the basis of the transmission of electricity using magnetic fields between the charger and the electronic device. The system enables wireless charging at distances of up to several metres, with the final aim of installing public \"charging spots\" on the streets in order to enable easy charging around the clock.\nScientists at Fujitsu Laboratories are planning to commercially sell products including the new wireless charging system as early as 2012 but did not make it clear how much they would cost. \"This technology makes it possible to add compact wireless charging functions into mobile phones and enabling several portable devices to be charged at the same time without any restrictions on their position in association with the charger,\" the company said in a statement.\nThe growing popularity of portable electronic devices ranging from iPads to e-readers is expected to fuel a boom in wireless recharging technology developments over the coming decade. \nMobile phone users in Japan can currently fill up their batteries using disposable portable plug-in battery-operated devices -- available at most train stations and convenience stores -- although phone companies warn any use for too long can damage the phones.\nThe new system displayed by Fujitsu, however, is significantly advanced and represents the next generation of portable recharging systems...\nQuestion: What is certain according to the passage is that_.\nOptions: A: the charging system can serve one portable electronic device at a time\nB: all the convenience stores in Japan can provide the charging service now\nC: wireless charging works within a distance of up to several metres\nD: the new product doesn't look promising\n",

During my youth he never missed a school play or softball game. In fact, he wasso supportive that I sometimes longed for one of those dads who dressed better and cared less. But my dad would forever be the guy wearing shorts with dress shoes and black socks, cheering me on, expecting greatness. \nHis other standard question - How's the car? - used to strike me as a waste of long-distance dollars from a man who once suggested making a list of what you want to talk about before calling someone out of state. What I now realize is that \"How's the car?\" is not about the car. It's a father's way of asking his adult daughter how she is doing. The advantage is that if there's something wrong with the car, he knows what to do about it and how much it will cost, whereas if you're having problems about marriage or doubting a career choice, he might have to act Mom on the line. \nAt age thirty I finally took the plunge   into adulthood by renting a car without my dad's help or advice. I'm sure my dad was hurt rather than proud. Though a daughter's independence is evidence of a job well done, it still implies the job's done, and many fathers are unwilling to retire. Even when my dad was overworked, he'd happily jump on a plane if I said I needed help. His frequent question \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" underlines the fact that he wishes there was still something he could provide. It's interesting: even though we're tied by blood and I love him no matter what, he still seems to need a concrete function - suggesting stocks, finding the cheapest plane fare - to feel he has a role in my life.\nQuestion: The author's father always showed up in his daughter's school activities to   _  .\nOptions: A: watch them out of his own curiosity\nB: guarantee she would perform well\nC: support her in all possible ways\nD: show his own lack of fatherly love\n",

Supporters of advanced education for women faced many problems. States did require each town to provide a school for children, but teachers were often poorly prepared. Most young women were not able to continue on with their education in private schools. If they did, they often were not taught much except the French language, how to sew   clothing, and music.\nMary Lyon felt that women's education was extremely important. Through her lifelong work for education she became the most famous woman in the 19th century America. She believed that women were teachers both at home and in the classroom. And she believed that efforts to better educate young women also served God. If women were better educated, she felt, they could teach in local schools throughout the United States and in foreign countries.\nIn 1837, Mary Lyon opened Mount Holyoke Seminary for Women. Only four teachers and the first class of eighty young women lived and studied in the building when the school opened. But Mary knew the importance of what had been established   -- the first independent school for the higher education of women. The school continued to grow. In 1893, under a state law, Mount Holyoke Female Seminary became a college. Mount Holyoke College was the first college to offer women the same education as was offered to men.\nPeople who have studied Mary Lyon say she was not fighting a battle   of equality between men and women, yet she knew she wanted more for women. Her efforts led to the spread of higher education for women in the United States. Historians say she was the strongest influence on the education of American young people during the middle of the 19th century.\nQuestion: What did Mary Lyon think would be a result of better education for women?\nOptions: A: They could be teachers in local schools in the USA and in foreign countries.\nB: They could help their children with the homework.\nC: They could help their husbands with the work.\nD: They could help their parents with the housework.\n",

Daydreaming then may be one way that the unconscious and conscious states of mind have silent dialogues.\"\nEarly psychology experts paid no attention to the importance of daydreams or even considered them harmful. In the past daydreaming was thought to be a cause of some mental illnesses. They did not have a better understanding of daydreams until the late 1980's. Eric Klinger, a professor of psychology, is the writer of the book DAYDREAMING. Klinger says. \"We know now that daydreaming is one of the main ways that we organize our lives, learn from our experiences, and plan for our futures... Daydreams really are a window on the things we fear and the things we long for in life.\"\nDaydreams are usually very simple and direct, quite unlike sleep dreams, which may be hard to understand. It's easier to gain a deep understanding of your life by paying close attention to your daydreams than by trying to examine your sleep dreams carefully. Daydreams help you recognize the difficult situations in our life and find out a possible way of dealing with them.\nDaydreams cannot be predicted. They move off in unexpected directions which may be creative and full of ideas. For many famous artists and scientists, daydreams were and are a main source of creative energy.\nQuestion: Which of the following can lead to daydreams according to the text?\nOptions: A: Absence of attention.\nB: Illness in mind.\nC: Lack of sleep at night.\nD: None of the above.\n",

  "instruction": "Read the article, and answer the question by replying A, B, C or D.\n\nArticle: I am a psychologist. I first met Timothy, a quiet, overweight eleven-year-old boy, when his mother brought him to me to discuss his declining grades. A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.\nWhat if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.\nPlay, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.\nExperts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount). Having an extra two hours an evening to play, relax, or see a friend would soundly benefit any child's life quality.\nQuestion: What did the writer think of Timothy after learning about his typical day?\nOptions: A: Timothy was very hardworking.\nB: Timothy was being mistreated.\nC: Timothy had a heavy burden.\nD: Timothy was enjoying his childhood.\n",

Energy-efficient doors are insulated  and seal tightly to prevent air from leaking through or around them. If your doors are in good shape and you don't want to replace them, make sure they seal tightly and have door sweeps at the bottom to prevent air leaks. Installing insulated storm doors provides an additional barrier to leaking air. Most homes have many more windows than doors. Replacing older windows with new energy-efficient ones can reduce air leaks and utility bills. The best windows shut tightly and are constructed of two or more pieces of glass separated by a gas that does not conduct heat well. If you cannot replace older windows, there are several things you can do to make them more energy efficient. First, caulk(...) any cracks around the windows and make sure they seal tightly. Add storm windows or sheets of clear plastic to the outside to create additional air barriers.

Most of the fish, crabs, and other animals have disappeared. The reef is sick and dying.\nCoral reefs are often called \"the rainforests of the sea\" because of their abundance of life forms. A great diversity of animals finds food and shelter in every crack and crevice.\nToday's reefs are about 10,000 years old. Found in sunny, shallow water in warm seas all over the world, reefs are made up of the hard shells of millions of corals. As corals live and die, they create a giant, rocky honeycomb. Only a thin top layer is living coral.\nA reef grows only about as fast as your fingernails--three-quarters of an inch a year. But coral reefs are huge, and in time a healthy reef can be thousands of miles long.\nMillions of people around the world rely on reef fish and other animals for food. And reefs provide protection from storms at sea. Without thousands of miles of reefs surrounding coastal areas, many beaches and even whole islands could be destroyed by the pounding of powerful ocean waves.\n\"Let's say a grazing animal like the parrot fish is overfished,\" Michele explains. \"Without them, the kind of algae   that the fish feed on could grow like weeds and take over the reef.

Many reefs around the world--including the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the reefs off the Florida Keys in the United States--are now protected areas where scientists study how to keep reefs healthy.

Franklin hoped to show that nature's tremendous displays of electricity in lightning were the same thing as the feeble electric sparks scientists of the day were producing in their laboratories. He built a square kite to which he attached an iron wire. He flew the kite with a hemp string , and near the base of the string he tied a large brass key. The kite rose into a dark thundercloud, where the iron wire picked up electrical charges. Franklin noticed that the strands of the string  were beginning to stand up with electricity. As rain wet the string, it conducted more electricity. Standing in the shelter of a shed, Franklin cautiously reached out his finger to touch the brass key. A series of sparks jumped from the key to his finger. He thus proved that lightning and electricity are the same. We now know that this experiment was a dangerous one, for Franklin might have been killed by a bolt of lighting.\nQuestion: The best title for this passage is   _  .\nOptions: A: The Discover of Electricity\nB: The kite and Science\nC: Franklin, a Great Scientist\nD: Franklin's Experiment with Lightning\n",

Even silence means different things in different places.\nWhen trying to communicate in a foreign language, it's natural to use gestures as a way of explaining your points.\nTapping your finger to your temple is a gesture to show memory in North America, but suggests insanity in Russia. Even nodding one's head to show \"yes\" or shaking one's head to show \"no\" can be misunderstood abroad. The yes-no gestures are different in countries like Bulgaria and Albania. In Turkey, \"no\" is gestured by nodding the head up and down.\nIt's not just individual gestures that can cause miscommunication, but the rate of gesturing can also cause miscommunication. Some countries, like Italy and Spain, are known for talking with their hands. Others use few body movements as a form of politeness. In parts of East Asia, the gesture is considered unpleasant behavior, and even rude.\nBritain, along with many countries of northern Europe and the Far East, is classed as a \"non-contact\"culture, in which there's very little physical contact in people's daily communication. Even accidentally touching someone's arm is considered rude. By comparison, in the high-contact cultures of the Middle East, Latin America, and southern Europe, physical touch is a big part of socializing.\nNaturally, these different standards of contact can lead to misunderstanding. An Argentinian may see a Scandinavian as cold, while the Scandinavian may see the Argentinian as impolite.\nIn most Western countries, frequent eye contact is a sign of confidence and attentiveness. But in many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, however, unbroken eye contact would be considered rude. These cultures tend to pay more attention to hierarchy , and avoiding eye contact is a sign of respect for bosses and elder.

Most people will agree that the thatched roof is an essential part of the attraction of the English countryside. \nThatching is in fact the oldest of all the building crafts practiced in the British Isles. Although thatch has always been used for cottage and farm buildings, it was once used for castles and churches, too.   \nThatching is a solitary craft, which often runs in families.

Over 800 full-time thatchers are employed in England and Wales today, maintaining and renewing the old roofs as well as thatching newer houses. Many property owners choose thatch not only for its beauty but because they know it will keep them cool in summer and warm in winter. \nIn fact, if we look at developing countries, over half the world lives under thatch, but they all do it in different ways. People in developing countries are often unwilling to go back to traditional materials and would prefer modern buildings.

Technology is developing at a very fast rate, and what most people did not even think could be real a few years ago is now becoming a reality. Although many will use and advertise modern technology for many of its achievements and advancements, what many don't realize is that it has affected and continues to affect society and people in general in a negative way.\nNewspaper companies, as we all know, have been hit very hard by the advancements in technology. Big newspapers have been forced to either lay off a percentage of their work force or shut down altogether because news is readily available for free on the Internet. Music does not have to be purchased at a music store any more because MP3 files are readily available on the Internet as well, thus causing big music store chains to shut their doors for good. The movie industry has also been hit hard because DVD sales have decreased since people can pay for and download their favorite movies online.\nTechnology has its benefits, but when you take a look at how people communicate with one another, you will quickly see that it has a negative impact. Modern technology has allowed people to communicate with just about anyone they want to at any given time. The fact remains that people do not _ personally with one another as often as they used to. This has created a barrier for face-to-face communication among people because they no longer have to hold a meeting in an office or they no longer have to call friends or family members together to wish them a happy birthday or congratulate them on their recent success.\nAs a result, people don't feel the urgent need to step outside of their home to find entertainment, such as participating in a dynamic game of basketball with friends, meeting a friend at a coffee shop, etc.\nQuestion: Which of the following is the best title for the passage?\nOptions: A: The negative effects of advancing technology\nB: The benefits of the modern technology\nC: The development of the modern technology\nD: The social problems caused by the technology\n",

However, the real movie capital is Mumbai, in India. Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called \"Bollywood.\" Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollywood--more than 800 films a year.\nThe movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a \"masala\" film. (\"Masala\" is an Indian word for a mixture of species.)\nAnother big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script is finished. The director and writer can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script   by hand instead of taking time to type it.\nBollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot  scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million US dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million US dollars for a Hollywood film, thirty times as much!\nQuestion: Which of the statements would the writer probably agree with?\nOptions: A: Most Bollywood movies are very similar.\nB: It takes a lot of money to make a good movie.\nC: Only Indian people can understand Bollywood movies.\nD: Hollywood movies are too short.\n",

In 1988 , when The World light-heartedly ranked 50 countries according to where would be the best place to be born in 1988 , America indeed came top . But which country will be the best for a baby born in 2015 ?\nTo answer this , the Economist Intelligence Unit ( EIU ) , has this time turned deadly serious . It attempts to measure which country will provide the best opportunities for a healthy , safe and prosperous life in the years ahead . Its quality-of-life index links the results of subjective life-satisfaction surveys - how happy people say they are - to objective determinants of the quality of life . Being rich helps more than anything else , but it is not all that counts ; things like crime , trust in public institutions and the health of family life matter too . In all , the index takes 11 significant factors into account .\nDespite the global economic crisis , times have in certain respects never been so good . Output growth rates have been decreasing across the world , but income levels are at or near historic highs , Life expectancy continues to increase steadily and political freedoms have become better known across the globe .\nWhat does all this mean for where a baby might be luckiest to be born in 2015 ? After calculation , the EIU has Switzerland comfortably in the top spot , with Australia second . Small economies occupy the top ten . Half of these are European , but only one , the Netherlands , is from the euro zone . The largest European economies ( Germany , France and Britain ) do not do particularly well . America , where babies will inherit the large debts of the boomer generation , stays in 16th place .

  "instruction": "Read the article, and answer the question by replying A, B, C or D.\n\nArticle: prefix = st1 /Wuthering Heights has a difficult narrative structure. The story begins in 1801. It is first narrated by Lockwood, a visitor staying in Thrushcross Grange, one of the two houses, where we can meet different characters in the novel. Lockwood is a narrow, dull man who is basically afraid of feeling; as a result, he is a bad man who lives emotionally through a dirty interest in the lives of others. It is this side of his character that leads into the main narrative stream of the novel. His interest in what he sees and experiences on his visits to Wuthering Heights leads him to encourage  Nelly Dean, the house-keeper at the Grange, to provide him with the information concerning the people that he has met: Heathcliff, Cathy, Hareton, Joseph and, of course, the ghost of Catherine.\nNelly Dean's story forms the major part of the narrative. While Nelly is meant to be an objective narrator, she has a lot to do with what has happened over the past twenty-five years that have led to the present state of affairs. Therefore, as readers, we need to realize how Nelly presents events and characters and her own role in determining the course of events.\nThe final part of the novel concerns the immediate future and provides us with the results of Lockwood's visit to the Heights and the appearance of Catherine's ghost. It is narrated by both Lockwood and Nelly.\nFinally, Isabella, the one time wife of Heathcliff, through a letter, narrates one middle part of the novel.\nAlthough this narrative structure may, at first, be very difficult, it is necessary because in the world of the novel, time order of the years is not so important; the events of twenty-five years ago are as much a part of the present as those in which Lockwood finds himself in 1801.\nQuestion: This passage is quite probably   _  .\nOptions: A: a piece of news\nB: a reading guide\nC: a writing guide\nD: an advertisement of a novel\n",

There is a pickpocket looking for you. World travelers, away from home and usually carrying much money, are often troubled by pickpockets in foreign countries, but they should remember that there are pickpockets in their own country, too.\n              A typical pickpocket is under forty years of age, usually a male. He has nimble fingers and has trained himself in running. Generally, he carries a newspaper or magazine in his hand. He may appear fairly clever and pretend to be calm. He has learned his job from another pickpocket, and he repays his \"teacher\" by giving him a percentage of the money or things which he steals.\n              The skilled pickpocket always operates in crowded places. Very well-dressed men and slightly drunken men are the favorite objects of the pickpocket.\n              An average-sized department store hires about six or seven full-time detectives. These men and women are constantly looking for pickpockets quickly. But a good pickpocket knows these things and is very careful. He is especially busy on buses, trains and subways between 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. when there are many shoppers with much money to spend. He carefully remembers the payday and bonus times of companies.\n              Pickpocketing and stealing from a shop together represent about 75% of daytime little crimes in America. The sentence for these crimes is usually from three to five years in prison. After finishing their sentence, pickpockets and thieves seldom reform; they usually advance to more serious crimes.\nQuestion: Why is a pickpocket especially busy on buses between 1:00 a.m. and 3:00_p.m.?\nOptions: A: Because this is the time when detectives have a rest.\nB: Because this is the time when many shoppers carry much money to spend.\nC: Because this is the time when companies pay bonus to their employees.\nD: Because this is the time when their hands are nimblest.\n",

Decades ago, Kodak predicted that digital photography would overtake film   -- and in fact, Kodak invented the first digital camera in 1975 -- but in a fateful decision, the company chose to shelf its new discovery to focus on its traditional film business.\n\"It wasn't that Kodak was blind to the future\", said Rebecca Henderson, a professor at Harvard Business School, but rather that it failed to execute on a strategy to confront it. By the time the company realized its mistake, it was too late.\nKodak is an example of a firm that was very much aware that they had to adapt, and spent a lot of money trying to do so, but ultimately failed. Large companies have a difficult time switching into new markets because there is a temptation to put existing assets   into the new businesses.\nAlthough Kodak predicted the unavoidable rise of digital photography, its corporate   culture was too rooted in the successes of the past for it to make the clean break necessary to fully embrace the future. They were a company stuck in time. Their history was so important to them. Now their history has become a liability.\nKodak's downfall over the last several decades was dramatic. In 1976, the company commanded 90% of the market for photographic film and 85% of the market for cameras. But the 1980s brought new competition from Japanese film company Fuji Photo, which undermined Kodak by offering lower prices for film and photo supplies.

The bid went instead to Fuji, which exploited its sponsorship...\nQuestion: Why does the author mention Kodak's invention of the first digital camera?\nOptions: A: To show its early attempt to reinvent itself.\nB: To show its effort to overcome complacency.\nC: To show its quick adaptation to the digital revolution.\nD: To show its will to compete with Japan's Fuji photo.\n",

But in order to work up the desire to rewrite, it is important to learn to like what you write at the early stage.\nI am surprised at the number of famous writers I know who say that they so dislike reading their own writing later that they even hate to look over the publishers' opinions. One reason we may dislike reading our own work is that we're often disappointed that the rich ideas in our minds seem very thin and plain when first written down. Jerry Fodor and Steven Pinker suggest that this fact may be a result of how our minds work.\nDifferent from popular belief, we do not usually think in the works and sentences of ordinary language but in symbols for ideas (known as 'mentalese' ), and writing our ideas down is an act of translation from that symbolic language. But while mentalese contains our thoughts in the form of a complex tapestry  ,writing can only be composed one thread at a time. Therefore it should not be surprising that our first attempt at expressing ideas should look so simple. It is only by repeatedly rewriting that we produce new threads and connect them to get closer to the ideas formed in our minds.\nWhen people write as if some strict critics   are looking over their shoulder, they are so worried about what this critic might say that they get stuck before they even start. Peter Elbow makes an excellent suggestion to deal with this problem. When writing we should have two different minds. At the first stage, we should see every idea, as well as the words we use to express it, as wonderful and worth putting down. It is only during rewrites that we should examine what we excitedly wrote in the first stage and check for weaknesses.\nQuestion: What can we conclude from the text?\nOptions: A: Most people believe we think in symbols.\nB: Loving our own writing is scientifically reasonable.\nC: The writers and critics can never reach an agreement.\nD: Thinking and writing are different stages of mind at work.\n",

These machines can do jobs in places that are too dangerous for humans. For example, they are being developed to work in nuclear power center, deep under the oceans and in outer space.\nJohn Marrit, a psychologist  in Williamsburg Massachusetts, helped develop the new machine. This is how they work. A machine is placed in an area far away from the person who operates it. The person wears special hard hat with television screens and sound equipment. The screens and sound equipment let the person see and hear exactly what the machine is seeing and hearing. Mr. Marrit says this gives the person the feeling of being in the same place as the machine. The idea, he says, is being there without going there. The person uses an electronic control to make the machine move. The machine copies the person's movements exactly. If the person raises his right arm, the machine raises the right arm, too. This means an expert can do a dangerous job while staying in the safe place. For example, a person can direct the machine to destroy a bomb without going near the bomb himself.\nQuestion: The machine   _  .\nOptions: A: follows the person's order\nB: is controlled by a computer\nC: does exactly what the person does\nD: is controlled by a television on the person's head\n",

Fourteen years ago the family decided to sell it forjust EUR25,000, but nobody wanted to buy it either. I met Blandy at a party. and he asked if I'd like to buy the island. Of course I said yes,but I had no money-I was just an art teacher.I tried to find some business partners, who all thought I was crazy.So I sold some of my possessions,put my savings together and bought it.Of course, my family. my friends-all thought I was mad.\nWhen the King originally sold the island,he signed a document, selling all the \"possessions and the dominions\"of the island.It means I can do what I want with it-I could start a restaurant, or a cinema but nobody thought someone would start a country.So that's what I did:I decided it would be my island, about the size of a one-bedroom house.\nI have both a Portuguese passport and one for Pontinha (where my passport number is 0001).There are four citizens: me, my wife, my son and my daughter.I am the police, the gardener,everything.I am whatever I want to be-that's the dream,isn't it?If l want to have a national flag,it could be blue today,red tomorrow.I can change it any time.Of course,my power is only absolute here, where I am the true sovereign.\nI don't live in my country full time, but I am often there.My family sometimes drops by, and other people come every day because the country is free for tourists to visit; I never close for bad weather.Sometimes I come here when I'm feeling lively,after a few drinks.\nMadeira is surrounded by water,but for some reason we all have to pay to swim in the ocean now,at the swimming spots.However.I have my island,which means I can come swimming whenever I want-it's as if someone has given me the key to the waters.\nOur lives are gone...\nQuestion: How did the author get the island?\nOptions: A: It was a present from Blandy.\nB: The king sold it to him.\nC: He inherited from his father.\nD: He bought it from Blandy.\n",

Most people will agree that the thatched roof is an essential part of the attraction of the English countryside. \nThatching is in fact the oldest of all the building crafts practiced in the British Isles. Although thatch has always been used for cottage and farm buildings, it was once used for castles and churches, too.   \nThatching is a solitary craft, which often runs in families. The craft of thatching as it is practiced has today changed very little since the Middle Ages. Over 800 full-time thatchers are employed in England and Wales today, maintaining and renewing the old roofs as well as thatching newer houses. Many property owners choose thatch not only for its beauty but because they know it will keep them cool in summer and warm in winter. \nIn fact, if we look at developing countries, over half the world lives under thatch, but they all do it in different ways. People in developing countries are often unwilling to go back to traditional materials and would prefer modern buildings. However, they may lack the money to allow them to import the necessary materials. Their temporary mud huts with thatched roofs of wild grasses often only last six months. Thatch which has been done the British way lasts from twenty to sixty years, and is an effective defence against the heat.\nQuestion: Thatched houses are still preferred because of   _  .\nOptions: A: their style and comfort\nB: their durability\nC: their easy maintenance\nD: their cheap and ready-made materials\n",

There, \"I'm having a dinner party\" means \"I'm booking a table for 12 at a restaurant you can't afford and we'll be sharing the cheque evenly, no matter what you eat.\"\nWorse, in Manhattan there is always someone who leaves before the bill arrives.

The animal rights group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), which said it received details on the shark's death from two whistleblowers\n , criticized the AHA in a letter over the shark's death.\n\"Sharks are sensitive animals who, in captivity , require a highly specialized and controlled environment,\" the PETA letter read. \"Given the delicate nature of this species, why would the AHA approve the transport and use of this animal?\"\nThe shark was placed into a 227- liter outdoor tank in the Van Nuys suburb of Los Angeles, said Karen Rosa, a senior adviser of the AHA.

Yet most people who eat fast food know it's bad for them. So why do they keep eating it?\nThe answer is simple: the benefits of eating fast food outweigh the long-term implications for most people. However, once you read these reasons why all those trips to the drive through may be slowly killing you, you may just want to stop eating fast food after all.\n1. Fast food makes you fat.\nA 15-year study of over 3,000 people found that eating fast food is linked to weight gain and insulin resistance. In others words, fast food makes you fat and increases your risk of type 2 diabetes. You probably know this already. But here's something you may not know.\n2. Fast food is addictive.\nThe more you eat fast food, the more you crave it. One study found that fast food is \"a potentially addictive substance that is most likely to create dependence in vulnerable populations.\" If you eat fast food once a week or more, you may be addicted to it.\n3. Fast food is affecting your kids.\nAccording to the CDC, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years. Kids have an amazing ability to recall ads they've seen. Fast food marketers know this, and design ads accordingly. Research shows strong associations between increases in advertising for non-nutritious foods and rates of childhood obesity.\n4. Fast food \"burgers\" don't have much burger in them.\nOne study found that most fast food burgers are composed of about 50 percent water and the actual meat content is only 2.1 to 14.8 percent. So what makes up the rest of it, you ask? Chemical fillers and preservatives, mostly. That's why we see read horror stories about burgers that don't go bad.\n5. Even \"healthy\" fast food isn't that healthy.\nFast food restaurants are catering to consumer demands to produce healthier options. The problem is, their definition of \"healthy\" is quite lax. One of the healthiest dishes at Burger King,...\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the passage?\nOptions: A: To help us make right decisions\nB: To advise us to stop eating fast food\nC: To tell us how to keep fit\nD: To encourage us to be humane to animals\n",

Unfortunately, most teachers do not adopt a long -term approach that guarantees that their students will be able to use English outside the classroom. So students only concentrate on one skill which is writing. Thus their listening and speaking skills are disabled. What is important to them is to pass the exam which is primarily based on writing .Teachers are not only concentrated with providing their students with questions that are similar to those of the final exam, particularly General Secondary Education Certificate (GSEC) Examination, so students spend most of their time answering typical exam questions.\nMost students' scores are high; a lot of students get full marks. However, few students are able to communicate in English because their role plays. As a result, a lot of students complain that they are unable to understand and talk fluently with native speakers of English.\nTo enable students to communicate freely and spontaneously  in English, I bring features of real communication into language practice, I always ask students about their own experiences, and suggest groups of students practice what they have learned outside the classroom. This helps lower-achieving students absorb language. Furthermore, role play is a very effective way to improve speaking skills particularly if it is connected to the experience of the students.\nQuestion: Who will responsible for the gap between school English and real English?\nOptions: A: Their parents\nB: The students\nC: The school\nD: The education sys tem\n",

The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons \"capitals of industry\" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel \"robber barons\", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth.\nThe early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large.\nAs the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business.\nThere were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials.

Only when you are there, you may start to appreciate and understand what a difference to live in a nation with a population of 1.3 billion.\nChina offers variety choices for visitors. If you are interested in Chinese history, Chinese culture and Chinese scenery, your trip will be very fulfilled and very interesting. If you want to enjoy a peaceful sunshine beach holiday, there are plenty of tourist areas along the coastal line, which have unspoiled beaches and luxury hotels for visitors. In Hainan Island, the beautiful Sanya beaches are opened the whole year around and there is no winter in this island. If you want excitements and nightlife, stay in big cities. There are many places every night for international gathering. If you are adventurers, go to remote areas to watch wild life or visit minorities  to see how they live in the hillsides or desert. If you are sporty, take a cycle trip along the countryside, enjoy the rural  life and meet with Chinese people long the route.\nYou may have heard or read a lot about China from books, newspapers, magazines and TV programs. Some of them are true but most of them are out of date, incorrect or even false. China is different from many of your previous experiences and may shock you in many ways. This is what China is!\nThis country is changing and progressing every day. Yet it is still a developing country. After the economic reform, most of the developments concentrate in major cities and remote areas  are still very backward. China is a very populated nation and people have to cope with the crowded environment. Foreign visitors may not get used to the mentality of the people and sometimes become frustrated with the situation, which they never experienced before. Basically Chinese are reserve, peaceful and nice. They are very polite too but in their own way. When a foreigner is willing to take a more positive attitude to recognize the difference, the trip will become worthwhile or you may...\nQuestion: According to the passage, if you go to China, you can enjoy all but   _  .\nOptions: A: mountain climbing\nB: sunshine beach\nC: rural life\nD: watching wild life\n",

They are absolute opportunists (especially when it comes to rewards). They defend their territory . And in general, they don't like cats. Perhaps that explains a new survey showing that millionaires are far more dog-friendly than the rest of Americans.\nAccording to a study by Spectrem Group, 58% of millionaire pet owners have a dog. Only 37% own a cat. Only 3% keep fish, 2% birds and 2% have a horse. Similarly, 39% of U. S. households own a dog, compared to 33% of households owning a cat, released by the Humane Society.\nJennifer Cona, a trust and estates attorney  and partner with Genser Subow Genser & Cona in New York, does a lot of work on pet trusts. She said of all the pet trusts she's worked on, 90% are for dogs and only 10% are for cats.\nShe said dogs provide one thing especially important for the wealthy: unconditional love.\n\"You don't get that from a cat,\" she said, \"Dogs are like children for some families, except that they don't mess up in college or run off with money. Sometimes it's easy to see why dogs are the favorite children.\"\nMillionaires show their love for their dogs in part by their spending. One quarter of millionaire pet owners spend more than $1, 000 a year on their pets, the Spectrem study said, while more than half spend more than $500 a year.\nMany would say those numbers are understated, given all the diamond-dog collars, dog foods and booming dog spas in evidence these days, not to mention the medical bills.\nThe survey showed 34% of pet owners spend money on decorating, while 6% spend on \"sweaters, outfits and costumes.\"\nMore than half of millionaire pet owners spend money on teeth cleaning for their pets. More than 16%, meanwhile, said they would spend money on reconstructive surgeries and \"anti-anxiety, anti-depression\" medication for their pets.\nQuestion: What does Jennifer Cona probably think of millionaires owning pet dogs ?\nOptions: A: Ridiculous.\nB: Acceptable.\nC: Negative.\nD: Indifferent.\n",

All the road markings and signs are shown in two languages -- English and Welsh  . Not all visitors to Britain know that other languages are spoken here. There's the Gaelic   language in Scotland and a few people speak Cornish  in the southwest of England, but the most widely spoken language in the UK besides English is Welsh.\nPerhaps the first Welsh word you'll see on the road into Wales is ARAF. There's a helpful English translation next to it -- SLOW. As you can see, Welsh looks quite different from English. It sounds very different, too. Welsh looks and sounds so different from English because it's a Celtic language. Celtic cultures still exist around the edges of the UK -- in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and also in parts of France. For hundreds of years, almost everyone in Wales spoke Welsh, but nowadays there are about 600 thousand Welsh speakers -- around 20% of the population.\nSo is Welsh dying out? Not at all! Nowadays, all school children in Wales study Welsh and many choose to go to an all Welsh-speaking school. You can get public information in Welsh, speak Welsh in court or take a course at university in Welsh. People surf the Internet in Welsh, keep up with friends on Facebook and write blogs in Welsh.\nBy the way,\"Croeso I Gymru!\" means \"Welcome to Wales!\"  I hope you'll be able to visit it one day.\nQuestion: What is the author's purpose of writing the passage?\nOptions: A: To explain a typical Welsh term.\nB: To compare English with Welsh.\nC: To give an introduction to Welsh.\nD: To encourage people to visit Wales.\n",

I pull back the curtains and the sky is dark grey. \nHearing my brother is getting up, I go downstairs to make him a cup of tea. He's down in the kitchen about five minutes later, wearing his work clothes, eyes mostly closed against the morning. \n\"Morning.\" I say. \n\"Uh huh.\" \nI leave him to work out what he is going to eat and go back to my room, and get back beneath the quilt . \nThis morning I want to think a while.

On my sixth birthday he bought me a box of 99 crayons. On my eighth birthday he bought me an easel  , a real one, not a kiddie's. On my ninth birthday he bought me oils.

It shows that most students considered understanding spoken English to be their biggest problem on arrival. This was followed by speaking. Writing increased as a problem as students discovered difficulties in writing papers that they were now expected to hand in. Reading remained as a big problem.\nInformation gained helped us in determining where special attention should be paid in our course. Although many students have chosen to join the course with a reasonable motivation, we considered it important to note what seemed to encourage interest. Nearly all the students have experienced some kind of grammar-based English teaching in their own country. To use the same method would be self-defeating because it might reduce motivation, especially if it has failed in the past. Therefore a different method may help because it is different.\nVariety of activity was also seen as a way of maintaining or increasing motivation. Several years ago we had one timetable that operated throughout, but we soon found that both the students and the teachers lost interest about halfway through the ten weeks. This led us to a major re-think, so in the end we brought it into line with the expressed language needs of the students.\nQuestion: What does the passage want to tell us?\nOptions: A: Foreign students have more problems.\nB: There are many ways to improve English.\nC: Teaching should meet students' needs.\nD: English learning problems should be studied again.\n",

Every so often, one of those magazines would run an article on the \"Car of the Future\". They featured unconventional things like small nuclear reactors as power sources. Yet, frankly, my car doesn't do anything that my brother's Studebaker didn't do. It goes, it stops, it burns gasoline. I still have to steer it, and it still runs into things if I don't steer it carefully.\nBut guess what? All of these things are likely to change in the not-so-distant future. It may not burn gasoline, I may not have to steer it, and it may be a lot better at not running into things.\nAirbags aren't the be-all and end-all in safety. In fact, considering the recent news about people occasionally being killed by their airbags in low-speed crashes, they obviously still need some development. But they aren't going away, and in fact, you can expect to see cars appearing with additional, side-impact airbags, something some European car manufacturers already offer.\nBetter than systems to minimize injury in the event of an accident, however, are systems that minimize the likelihood of an accident happening in the first place? Future cars may be able to remove many of the major causes of accidents, including drunk-driving, and tailgating  . Cars could be equipped with sensors that can detect alcohol in a driver's system and prevent the car from being started, for example. As early as next year, you'll be able to buy cars with radar-equipped control systems. If the radar determines you're closing too quickly with the car in front, it will ease up on the throttle . \nScientists are now working on a system that can brake, accelerate and steer a vehicle down a highway on its own. Will cars eventually be able to drive themselves?\nQuestion: By saying \"my car doesn't do anything that my brother's Studebaker didn't do\", the author means that   _  .\nOptions: A: my car is far better than my brother's\nB: my car is not as good as my brother's\nC: much improvement has been made in the design of cars recently\nD: not much has changed in the performance of cars so far\n",

But we may not realize that this can only be achieved by partnering with two new and strange allies : uncertainty and confusion. Most of us aren't trained to like confusion or to admit we feel hesitant and uncertain. In our schools and organizations, we place value on sounding certain and confident.\nAs life continues to speed up, I believe our changing world requires less certainty and far more curiosity. I'm not suggesting we let go of our beliefs, but that we become curious about what someone else believes. As we become open to the disturbing differences, sometimes we discover that another's way of interpreting the world is actually essential to our survival.\nFor me, the first step in becoming curious is to admit that I'm not succeeding in figuring things out by myself. If my solutions don't work as well as I'd like, I take these as signs that it's time to begin asking others what they think. I try to become a conscious listener, actively listening for differences.\nThere are many ways to listen for differences. Lately, I've been listening for what surprises me. This isn't easy -- I'm accustomed to sitting there, nodding my head as someone voices his opinions. But when I notice what surprises me, I'm able to see my own views more clearly, including my assumptions.\nIf you're willing to be disturbed and confused, I recommend you begin a conversation with someone who thinks differently from you. Listen for what's different and what surprises you. Try to stop the voice of judgment or opinion and just listen. At the end, notice whether you've learned something new.\nWe have the opportunity many times a day to be the one who listens to others and the one who is curious rather than certain.
